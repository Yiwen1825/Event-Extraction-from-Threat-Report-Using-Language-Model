Last week we first tweeted that the GuardiCore Global Sensor Network (GGSN) has detected a wide ransomware attack targeting MySQL databases. | AttackRansom
The attacks look like an evolution of the MongoDB ransomware attacks first reported earlier this year by Victor Gevers. | AttackRansom
Similarly to the MongoDB attacks, owners are instructed to pay a 0.2 Bitcoin ransom (approx.$200) to regain access to their content. | AttackRansom
We saw two very similar variations of the attack using two bitcoin wallets. | O
In this post we will describe in detail the attack flow and provide some recommendations on how to protect your databases from similar attacks along with attack IoCs. | AttackRansom
The attacks started at midnight at 00:15 on February 12 and lasted about 30 hours in which hundreds of attacks were reported by GGSN. | AttackRansom
We were able to trace all the attacks to 109.236.88.20, an IP address hosted by worldstream.nl, a Netherlands-based web hosting company. | AttackRansom
The attacker is (probably) running from a compromised mail server which also serves as HTTP(s) and FTP server. | O
Worldstream was notified a few days after we reported the attack. | O
The attack starts with ‘root’ password brute-forcing. | O
Once logged-in, it fetches a list of the existing MySQL databases and their tables and creates a new table called ‘WARNING’ that includes a contact email address, a bitcoin address and a payment demand. | AttackRansom
In one variant of the attack the table is added to an existing database; in other cases the table is added to a newly created database called ‘PLEASE_READ’. | O
The attacker will then delete the databases stored on the server and disconnect, sometimes without even dumping them first. | O
The attack as reported by GuardiCore Centra | O
We logged two versions of the ransom message: | O
INSERT INTO PLEASE_READ.`WARNING`(id, warning, Bitcoin_Address, Email) VALUES(‘1′,’Send 0.2 BTC to this address and contact this email with your ip or db_name of your server to recover your database! | O
Your DB is Backed up to our servers!’, ‘1ET9NHZEXXQ34qSP46vKg8mrWgT89cfZoY’, ‘backupservice@mail2tor.com’) | O
INSERT INTO `WARNING`(id, warning) | O
VALUES(1, ‘SEND 0.2 BTC TO THIS ADDRESS 1Kg9nGFdAoZWmrn1qPMZstam3CXLgcxPA9 AND GO TO THIS SITE http://sognd75g4isasu2v.onion/ TO RECOVER YOUR DATABASE! | O
The second version offers the owner to visit the following darknet web site ‘http://sognd75g4isasu2v.onion/’ to recover the lost data. | O
The darknet web site referenced in the ransom note. | O
Each version uses a different bitcoin wallet, 1Kg9nGFdAoZWmrn1qPMZstam3CXLgcxPA9 vs 1ET9NHZEXXQ34qSP46vKg8mrWgT89cfZoY and based on Blockchain public information people have been paying up. | O
