HR managers beware: Ransomware could be your next job applicant - TechRepublic | AttackRansom
A new ransomware campaign is infecting businesses by targeting a department that typically has to open email from strangers: Human resources. | O
Dubbed GoldenEye, a variant of Petya, the ransomware imitates a job application and currently targets German speakers, according to a Check Point report released Tuesday. | AttackPhishing
Here's how it works: An email appears in the HR representative's inbox with a brief message from the supposed applicant, and two attachments. | O
"The first attachment is a PDF containing a cover letter which has no malicious content and its primary purpose is to lull the victim into a false sense of security," the Check Point report said. | O
"The second attachment is an Excel file with malicious macros unbeknown to the receiver." | O
It also includes a message in German asking the HR representative to enable the content. | O
The ransomware presents its victim with a decryption code, which they can enter in a Dark Web portal to pay the ransom and unlock their files. | AttackRansom
Current ransom rates for GoldenEye begin at 1.3 bitcoins, or about $1,000. | O
Ransomware often targets victims via email attachments. | O
HR departments are especially susceptible, Check Point noted, due to the number of messages and attachments from unfamiliar people they receive. | O
