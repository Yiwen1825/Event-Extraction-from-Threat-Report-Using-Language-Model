Hipchat resets user passwords after possible breach | CSO Online
HipChat has reset all its users' passwords after what it called a security incident that may have exposed their names, email addresses and hashed password information. | AttackDatabreach
In some cases, attackers may have accessed messages and content in chat rooms, HipChat said in a Monday blog post.  | AttackDatabreach
But this happened in no more than 0.05 percent of the cases, each of which involved a domain URL, such as company.hipchat.com. | O
HipChat didn't say how many users may have been affected by the incident.  | DiscoverVulnerability
The passwords that may have been exposed would also be difficult to crack, the company said.  | AttackDatabreach
The data is hashed, or obscured, with the bcrypt algorithm, which transforms the passwords into a set of random-looking characters.  | O
For added security, HipChat "salted" each password with a random value before hashing it. | O
HipChat warned that chat room data including the room name and topic may have also been exposed.  | AttackDatabreach
But no financial or credit information was taken, the company said. | AttackDatabreach
HipChat is a popular messaging service used among enterprises, and an attack that exposed sensitive work-related chats could cause significant harm.  | AttackDatabreach
The service, which is owned by Atlassian, said it detected the security incident last weekend.  | O
It affected a server in the HipChat Cloud and was caused by a vulnerability in an unnamed, but popular, third-party library that HipChat.com used, the company said.  | DiscoverVulnerability
No other Atlassian systems were affected, the company said.  | DiscoverVulnerability
“We are confident we have isolated the affected systems and closed any unauthorized access,” HipChat said in its blog post. | DiscoverVulnerability
This is not the first time the messaging service has faced problems keeping accounts secure.  | O
In 2015, HipChat reset user passwords after detecting and blocking suspicious activity in which account information was stolen from less than 2 percent of its users. | AttackDatabreach
When breaches occur, security experts advise users to change their passwords for any accounts where they used the same login information.  | O
Users can consider using a password manager to help them store complex, tough-to-memorize passwords.  | O
HipChat has already sent an email to affected users, informing them of the password reset. | DiscoverVulnerability
In 2015, rival chat application Slack reported its own breach, and as a result rolled out two-factor authentication to beef up its account security.  | AttackDatabreach
HipChat does not offer two-factor authentication. | O
