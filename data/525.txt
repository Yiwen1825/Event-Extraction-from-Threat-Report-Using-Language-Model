Where there’s a will, there’s a way, and scammers are finding increasingly cunning ways to capitalise on the reach and popularity of the world’s global brands. | O
This time PayPal is the target, according to Proofpoint. | O
The company recently discovered a phishing email message which looked like a benign PayPal login, but in reality it was a “very well crafted” phishing webpage. | AttackPhishing
The page is available in multiple languages, which makes it seem all the more legitimate and across many different regions. | O
Behind the scenes, the phishing attack turned out to be complex and sophisticated, and Proofpoint says those are the real innovations. | AttackPhishing
The phishing attempts feature embedded URLs that direct users to the fake PayPal login. | AttackPhishing
This is done using a decommissioned PayPal service that allows a person to buy a gift card from a user. | O
The phishing attack then starts with a ‘reassuring welcome page’, Proofpoint says. | AttackPhishing
Users are then asked to confirm the credit card information. | O
After the phishing kit validates the card, it asks users to enter security information about the card, the link to their bank account and details and identification. | O
Proofpoint says that the particular phishing kit shows how ‘crimeware as a service’ is rapidly advancing, and will become a more common technique. | O
Proofpoint says it has notified PayPal of the phishing campaign and the findings. | AttackPhishing
