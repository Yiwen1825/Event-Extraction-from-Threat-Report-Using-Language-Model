Over the past few weeks, hackers have targeted thousands of publicly accessible servers running database software such as MongoDB and Hadoop, and held their data for ransom. | Ransom
Now someone is apparently taking matters into their owns hands, helpfully alerting admins that their databases are vulnerable to attack. | O
"It looks like a friendly warning," Victor Gevers, chairman of the non-profit GDI Foundation which discloses security issues to affected victims, told Motherboard in a Twitter message. | DiscoverVulnerability
Gevers has been tracking the malicious attacks since they began in December, and on Monday started following this rather strange twist. | O
But the vigilante, whoever they may be, is creating an empty folder called "your_db_is_not_secure" in some open databases. | O
So far, the message has been placed into 49 of the 2,641 open databases using the Cassandra software, Gevers told Motherboard. | O
It's not clear how effective this approach will actually be at informing potential victims, however, considering that database administrators might not even notice the slight change. | O
Gevers recently wrote in a tweet that the GDI Foundation has been informing victims too via email, and another group of security experts tried sending emails en masse automatically to potential targets. | O
If the messages don't get through to database owners, maybe the ransom notes will. | O
