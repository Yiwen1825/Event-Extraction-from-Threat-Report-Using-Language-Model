"The overall results were extremely worrying and revealed that password manager applications, despite their claims, do not provide enough protection mechanisms for the stored passwords and credentials," the research team concluded. | DiscoverVulnerability 
"Instead, they abuse the users' confidence and expose them to high risks." | O
In total, security researchers found 26 security bugs, ranging from low to critical-level issues. | DiscoverVulnerability 
The research team went public with their findings at the start of the week. | O
Initially, app makers fixed 23 of the 26 flaws, with Avast still lagging behind on three issues. | PatchVulnerability
