Ransomware app hosted in Google Play infects unsuspecting Android user | Ars Technica
 
 

Google Play, the official market for Android apps, was caught hosting a ransomware app that infected at least one real-world handset, security researchers said Tuesday. | O
The ransomware was dubbed Charger and was hidden inside an app called EnergyRescue, according to a blog post published by security firm Check Point Software. | O
Once installed, Charger stole SMS contacts and prompted unsuspecting users to grant it all-powerful administrator rights. | AttackDatabreach
If users clicked OK, the malicious app locked the device and displayed the following message: | AttackRansom

WE GIVE 100% GUARANTEE THAT ALL FILES WILL RESTORE AFTER WE RECEIVE PAYMENT. | O
WE WILL UNLOCK THE MOBILE DEVICE AND DELETE ALL YOUR DATA FROM OUR SERVER! | O

The app sought 0.2 Bitcoin, currently worth about $180. | O
In an e-mail, Check Point researchers said the app was available in Google Play for four days and had only a "handful" of downloads. | O
"We believe the attackers only wanted to test the waters and not spread it yet," the researchers told Ars. | O
The infection was detected by Check Point's mobile malware software, which the company sells to businesses. | O
Google officials have since removed the app and have thanked Check Point for raising awareness of the issue. | O
