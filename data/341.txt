Google Play, the official market for Android apps, was caught hosting a ransomware app that infected at least one real-world handset, security researchers said Tuesday. | O
The ransomware was dubbed Charger and was hidden inside an app called EnergyRescue, according to a blog post published by security firm Check Point Software. | O
Once installed, Charger stole SMS contacts and prompted unsuspecting users to grant it all-powerful administrator rights. | Databreach
If users clicked OK, the malicious app locked the device and displayed the following message: | Ransom
You need to pay for us, otherwise we will sell portion of your personal information on black market every 30 minutes. | Ransom
WE GIVE 100% GUARANTEE THAT ALL FILES WILL RESTORE AFTER WE RECEIVE PAYMENT. | O
WE WILL UNLOCK THE MOBILE DEVICE AND DELETE ALL YOUR DATA FROM OUR SERVER! | O
TURNING OFF YOUR PHONE IS MEANINGLESS, ALL YOUR DATA IS ALREADY STORED ON OUR SERVERS! | O
WE STILL CAN SELLING IT FOR SPAM, FAKE, BANK CRIME etcâ€¦ We collect and download all of your personal data. | Databreach
All information about your social networks, Bank accounts, Credit Cards. | Databreach
We collect all data about your friends and family. | Databreach
The app sought 0.2 Bitcoin, currently worth about $180. | O
In an e-mail, Check Point researchers said the app was available in Google Play for four days and had only a "handful" of downloads. | O
"We believe the attackers only wanted to test the waters and not spread it yet," the researchers told Ars. | O
The infection was detected by Check Point's mobile malware software, which the company sells to businesses. | O
Google officials have since removed the app and have thanked Check Point for raising awareness of the issue. | O
