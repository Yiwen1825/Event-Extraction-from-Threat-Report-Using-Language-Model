Universities often need to have a number of computers in classrooms ready for faculty and staff to use for presentations and Internet access, which can be a security challenge. | O
Carleton University is the latest to find that out when a regular inspection discovered USB keylogging devices had been plugged into six classroom PCs. | O
The computers themselves can’t store data, said Beth Gorham, Carleton’s manager of public affairs, so there was no risk of university data being captured. | AttackDatabreach
However, the PCs are connected to the campus network so keyloggers would be able to capture login information. | AttackDatabreach
As a result, all staff, faculty, contract instructors, and teaching assistants have been ordered to change their passwords. | O
In addition, the university has recommended all students do the same “out of an abundance of caution.” | O
“We have no indication that any personal information has been obtained,” she said. | AttackDatabreach
Discovery of the devices was made a week ago during a regular inspection of classroom devices by the instructional media services staff, Gorham said. | O
“Until now because presenters use USB memory sticks for presentations the USB ports of the computers hadn’t been locked,” Gorham said. | O
However, she said, since the discovery “those computers and others were secured [with locks] so this can’t happen again.” | O
And as a result of the incident, classroom inspections have been stepped up. | O
