Cybersecurity Firm Reveals Vulnerability in DJI’s Infrastructure (It’s Patched Now)
Researchers at cybersecurity company Check Point have today shared details of a vulnerability in DJI’s infrastructure that could have given hackers access to consumer and corporate user accounts, personal data, flight logs, photos, videos, and – if the user was flying with DJI’s FlightHub application – a live camera feed and map during missions. | DiscoverVulnerability
Check Point submitted a report to DJI’s Bug Bounty Program, highlighting a process in which an attacker could have gained access to a user’s account through a vulnerability discovered in the user identification process within DJI Forum. | DiscoverVulnerability
Check Point’s researchers found that DJI’s various platforms used a token to identify registered users across different aspects of the customer experience. | DiscoverVulnerability
Hackers could plant malicious links that would compromise accounts within that framework. | O
In a blog post outlining their investigation, Check Point explained the process of a possible exploit: | O
The vulnerability was accessed through DJI Forum, an online forum DJI runs for discussions about its products. A user who logged into DJI Forum, then clicked a specially-planted malicious link, could have had his or her login credentials stolen to allow access to other DJI online assets: | AttackDatabreach

We notified DJI about this vulnerability in March 2018 and DJI responded responsibly. | DiscoverVulnerability
The vulnerability has since been patched. | PatchVulnerability
DJI classified this vulnerability as high risk but low probability, and indicated there is no evidence this vulnerability was ever exploited by anyone other than Check Point researchers. | DiscoverVulnerability
Check Point even made a Mission Impossible-style trailer for their findings, which is… interesting. | O
