 Intercontinental Hotels Group Data Breach Affected 1,184 Hotels  
The Intercontinental Hotels Group data breach previously announced in February as affecting 12 hotels in the chain has proven to have been far more extensive than was first thought. | AttackDatabreach
Last week the group announced that the breach affected guests that used their credit cards to pay at franchisee hotels across the United States and in Puerto Rico between September 29, 2016 and December 29, 2016. | AttackDatabreach
According to the chain’s website, the Intercontinental Hotels Group data breach potentially affected guests who stayed at its Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Crowne Plaza, Staybridge Suites, Candlewood Suites, Hotel Indigo, and InterContinental Hotels. | AttackDatabreach 
The full list of hotels that have potentially been affected by the malware incident has been listed on the IHG website. | O 
In total, 1,184 of the group’s hotels have potentially been affected. | O
The Intercontinental Hotels Group data breach involved malware that had been downloaded onto its systems, which was capable of monitoring payment card systems and exfiltrating payment card data. | AttackDatabreach 
It does not appear that any other information other than card details and cardholders’ names were stolen by the attackers. | AttackDatabreach
The hotel group does not believe the data breach extended past December 29, 2016, although that cannot be entirely ruled out as it took until February/March for all of the affected hotels to be investigated and for confirmation to be received that the malware had been removed. | AttackDatabreach
Prior to the malware being installed, IHG had started installing the OHG Secure Payment Solution (SPS), which provides point to point encryption to prevent incidents such as this from resulting in the theft of clients’ data. | O  
Had the process started sooner, the Intercontinental Hotel Group data breach could have been prevented. | AttackDatabreach
Hotels that had implemented the SPS prior to September 29, 2016 were not affected and those that had implemented the solution between September 29, 2016 and December 29, 2016 stopped the malware from being able to locate and steal credit card data. | AttackDatabreach  
In those cases, only clients that used their credit cards at affected hotels between September 29, 2016 and when the SPS system was installed were affected. | O
Intercontinental Hotels Group Data Breach One of Many Affecting the Hospitality Sector
The Intercontinental Hotels Group data breach stands out due to the extent to which the group was affected, with well over 1,100 hotels affected. | AttackDatabreach 
However, this is far from the only hotel group to have been affected by POS malware. |  Previous incidents have also been reported by Hard Rock Hotels, Hilton Hotels, Omni Hotels & Resorts and Trump Hotels. | O
Hotels, in particular hotel chains, are big targets for cybercriminals due to the size of the prize. | O 
Many hotel guests choose to pay for their rooms and services on credit cards rather than in cash, and each hotel services many thousands – often tens of thousands – of guests each year. | O
Globally, IHG hotels service more than 150 million guests every year, which is a tremendous number of credit and debit cards. | O 
Such a widespread malware infection would be highly lucrative for the attackers. | O 
Credit card numbers may only sell for a couple of dollars a time, but with that number of guests, an attack such as this would be a huge pay day for the attackers. | AttackDatabreach
