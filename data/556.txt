Social media phishing attacks jumped by a massive 500% in Q4, driven by a huge increase in fraudulent accounts including many posing as customer support for big name brands, according to Proofpoint. | AttackPhishing
The security vendor revealed the findings in its Q4 2016 Threat Summary and Year in Review report. | O
It claimed fraudulent accounts across sites like Twitter and Facebook increased 100% from the third to fourth quarter. | O
Such accounts are used for phishing, malware distribution, spam and other ends. In fact, Proofpoint observed a 20% increase in Facebook and Twitter spam from Q3 to Q4, with the quarter recording the second highest spam volume in the year. | AttackPhishing
Yet it was a particular variety of phishing that caught the eye. | O
So-called “angler phishing” is a relatively new tactic in which the black hats register fake Twitter accounts that masquerade as customer support accounts. | AttackPhishing
They monitor the real support accounts for irate customer messages and then quickly jump in to send messages back to those users loaded with malicious links. | O
The tactic was particularly common among financial services and entertainment accounts, according to the report. | O
Elsewhere, the number of new ransomware variants grew 30-fold over Q4, and malicious email campaigns grew significantly, with Q4's largest campaign 6.7 times the size of Q3's. | O
Some of the biggest campaigns apparently involved hundreds of millions of messages dropping Locky ransomware. | O
However, there was some good news, with scams involving the spoofing of CEO emails sent to CFOs falling 28% in the final quarter. | AttackPhishing
This is partly because CFOs are more cautious about the veracity of such messages, but can also be linked to a 33% surge in DMARC implementation which helped to block attempts to spoof the CEO’s email address. | AttackPhishing
In addition, exploit kits remained at low levels of activity after some high profile Angler EK arrests in Q2, although large scale malvertising campaigns persisted, Proofpoint claimed. | O
