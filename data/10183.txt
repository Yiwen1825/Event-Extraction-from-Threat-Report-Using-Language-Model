The hack in question would be able to retrieve more than just photos. | O
The vulnerablitiy is found in a just-in-time compiler. | DiscoverVulnerability
These are programs that translate code while a computer rather than before. | O
And because it’s software, it’s bound to have some vulnerabilities. | O
Software vulnerabilities are a common occurrence due to its complex nature. | O
While developers can continue fixing bugs, there’s no guarantee new holes won’t emerge. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
The hackers were able to exploit the JIT compiler with a malicious Wi-Fi access point. | O
