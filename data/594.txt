High Severity BIND Vulnerability Can Lead to A Crash | Threatpost | The first stop for security news
 
 

The Internet Systems Consortium patched the BIND domain name system this week, addressing a remotely exploitable vulnerability it considers high severity and said could lead to a crash. | PatchVulnerability
The issue affects servers that use both the DNS64 and RPZ function simultaneously. | DiscoverVulnerability
DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records. | O
It’s traditionally used to allow IPv6-only clients to receive IPv6 addresses proxied to IPv4 addresses. | O
The RPZ mechanism is used by Domain Name System recursive resolvers to allow for the customized handling of the resolution of collections of domain name information. | O
Versions 9.8.8, 9.9.3-S1, 9.9.3, 9.9.10b1, 9.10.0, and 9.10.5b1, 9.11.0 are all considered vulnerable, according to the ISC. | DiscoverVulnerability
When servers use both mechanisms simultaneously, a vulnerability (CVE-2017-3135) that stems from query processing could result in an inconsistent state, triggering either an INSIST assertion failure or an attempt to read through a NULL pointer, according to a security advisory published Wednesday. | DiscoverVulnerability
The INSIST assertion failure could lead to a subsequent abort, ISC said, while the NULL pointer in some instances can lead to a segmentation fault, which causes the process to be terminated. | O
Ramesh Damodaran and Aliaksandr Shubnik, engineers at Infoblox, a Silicon Valley firm that does DNS, DHCP and IP management, uncovered the vulnerability and reported it to the ISC. | DiscoverVulnerability
Damodaran previously helped identified an unspecified packet processing remote denial of service vulnerability in BIND 9. | DiscoverVulnerability
The Internet Systems Consortium patched the BIND domain name system this week, addressing what it calls a critical error condition in the software. | PatchVulnerability
Researchers find industrial control system malware similar to BlackEnergy, Havex, and Stuxnet going undetected on Google VirusTotal for years. | O
The Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) announced it is planning to patch versions of its DHCP to mitigate a denial of service vulnerability. | PatchVulnerability
