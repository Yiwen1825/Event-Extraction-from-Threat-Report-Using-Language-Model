Hackers are reportedly selling stolen data from the Qatar National Bank (QNB) and UAE InvestBank on the dark web. | AttackDatabreach 
Both the banks suffered major data breaches in 2016 and the data of thousands of customers was later leaked online by hackers. | AttackDatabreach 
Now, even as tensions escalate between the two Middle Eastern nations, cybercriminals appear to be cashing in on the underground cybercrime community. | O 
Hackers hit the QNB in April 2016 and the UAE InvestBank in May 2016. | AttackDatabreach  
The Sharjah-based InvestBank's stolen data was leaked online by a hacker going by the pseudonym "Buba", who demanded a $3m ransom from the bank. | AttackRansom 
The stolen data, including customers' financial details as well as personal details such as full names, addresses, passport numbers, phone numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers along with their CVV codes and more was leaked online by the hacker after the bank refused to pay up the ransom. | AttackRansom
