PhishMe security researchers warn that the Locky ransomware is relying on the same delivery infrastructure which was previously used for the Sage ransomware distribution. | O
Cybercriminals often share infrastructure between one another, so the fact that Locky and Sage use the same recourses is not that surprising. | O
However, the fact also shows that the crooks behind Locky are working on securing new distribution venues after the main Locky distributor – Necurs botnet – recently went silent. | O
The Sage ransomware first appeared on the malware stage at the end of last year and was analyzed early this year. | O
The first distribution email messages relied on racy or explicit narratives to fool victims into opening the malicious attachments. | AttackPhishing
Later, the operators abandoned this tactic and starting using business-related themes and random numbers in the subjects to avoid spam filters. | O
Some of the delivery emails didn’t come with a subject at all but they did use the victim`s name in the file attachment name. | O
This file attachment was usually a double-zipper archive that contained a malicious .js file or an Office document. | O
Other messages posed as a rejected financial transaction, failed deposit/refund or canceled order alerts in order to trick the users into opening them. | AttackPhishing
The campaign, according to PhishMe, used a .zip file (named “document_1.zip”), containing a JavaScript application in it, which would download the Sage ransomware in the form of a Windows executable. | O
The payload was retrieved from the domain affections[. | O
]top, and the malware relied on the same payment gateway’s Tor site as before, as well as the Tor2Web gateway addresses on rzunt3u2[. | O
Then, however, on January 26th, another phishing campaign was spotted to distribute the Locky ransomware, leveraging the same email messages and metadata. | AttackPhishing
]top was used as a part of the distribution for this infection on January 30th. | O
“This connection pushes the narrative forward in yet another way as the Locky distribution in question was yet another example of that ransomware being paired with the Kovter Trojan”. | O
The connection between Kovter and Locky has been already analyzed a couple of times. | O
Most recently, Microsoft discovered a two-step delivery technique which intended to drip Locky first, but if that failed, it switched to dropping the Kovter Trojan. | O
This sharing of infrastructure between Locky and Sage once again proves how cybercriminals often reuse delivery infrastructure and malware support. | O
The overlapping distribution of these two ransomware pieces can be seen as evidence of the commodity status for such infections. | O
