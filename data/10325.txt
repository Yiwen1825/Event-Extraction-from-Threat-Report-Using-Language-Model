Critical remote code execution flaw in Apache Struts exposes the enterprise to attack
The bug was found in the core infrastructure of Apache Struts 2. | DiscoverVulnerability
The Apache Software Foundation has patched a critical security vulnerability which affects all versions of Apache Struts 2. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
Uncovered by researchers from cybersecurity firm Semmle, the security flaw is caused by the insufficient validation of untrusted user data in the core Struts framework. | DiscoverVulnerability
When Apache Struts uses results with no namespace and in the same time, upper actions have no wild namespace. | O
The same opportunity for exploit exists when the URL tag is in use and there is no value or action set. | O
As the bug, CVE-2018-11776, has been discovered in the Struts core, the team says there are multiple attack vectors threat actors could use to exploit the vulnerability. | DiscoverVulnerability
If the alwaysSelectFullNamespace flag is set to true in the Struts configuration, which is automatically the case when the Struts Convention plugin is in use, or if a user's Struts configuration file contains a tag that does not specify the optional namespace attribute or specifies a wildcard namespace. | O
Man Yue Mo from the Semmle Security Research Team first reported the flaw. | DiscoverVulnerability
"This vulnerability affects commonly-used endpoints of Struts, which are likely to be exposed, opening up an attack vector to malicious hackers," Mo says. | DiscoverVulnerability
"On top of that, the weakness is related to the Struts OGNL language, which hackers are very familiar with, and are known to have been exploited in the past." | been exploited
The vulnerability affects all versions of Apache Struts 2. |
Companies which use the popular open-source framework are urged to update their builds immediately. | O
Users of Struts 2.3 are advised to upgrade to 2.3.35; users of Struts 2.5 need to upgrade to 2.5.17. | PatchVulnerability
As the latest releases only contain fixes for the vulnerability, Apache does not expect users to experience any backward compatibility issues. | PatchVulnerability
"Previous disclosures of similarly critical vulnerabilities have resulted in exploits being published within a day, putting critical infrastructure and customer data at risk," Semmle says. | DiscoverVulnerability
"All applications that use Struts are potentially vulnerable, even when no additional plugins have been enabled." | DiscoverVulnerability
Mo first reported the findings in April. | DiscoverVulnerability
By June, the Apache Struts team published the code which resolved the problem, leading to the release of official patches on August 22. | PatchVulnerability
