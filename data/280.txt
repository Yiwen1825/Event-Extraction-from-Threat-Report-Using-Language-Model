Researchers are now observing similar destructive attacks hitting openly accessible Hadoop and CouchDB deployments. | O
Security researchers Victor Gevers and Niall Merrigan, who monitored the MongoDB and Elasticsearch attacks so far, have also started keeping track of the new Hadoop and CouchDB victims. | O
The two have put together spreadsheets on Google Docs where they document the different attack signatures and messages left behind after data gets wiped from databases. | O
In the case of Hadoop, a framework used for distributed storage and processing of large data sets, the attacks observed so far can be described as vandalism. | O
That's because the attackers don't ask for payments to be made in exchange for returning the deleted data. | Ransom
Instead, their message instructs the Hadoop administrators to secure their deployments in the future. | O
According to Merrigan's latest count, 126 Hadoop instances have been wiped so far. | O
The number of victims is likely to increase because there are thousands of Hadoop deployments accessible from the internet -- although it's hard to say how many are vulnerable. | O
The attacks against MongoDB and Elasticsearch followed a similar pattern. | O
The number of MongoDB victims jumped from hundreds to thousands in a matter of hours and to tens of thousands within a week. | O
The latest count puts the number of wiped MongoDB databases at more than 34,000 and that of deleted Elasticsearch clusters at more than 4,600. | O
A group called Kraken0, responsible for most of the ransomware attacks against databases, is trying to sell its attack toolkit and a list of vulnerable MongoDB and Elasticsearch installations for the equivalent of US$500 in bitcoins. | O
The number of wiped CouchDB databases is also growing rapidly, reaching more than 400 so far. | O
CouchDB is a NoSQL-style database platform similar to MongoDB. | O
Unlike the Hadoop vandalism, the CouchDB attacks are accompanied by ransom messages, with attackers asking for 0.1 bitcoins (around $100) to return the data. | Ransom
Victims are advised against paying because, in many of the MongoDB attacks, there was no evidence that attackers had actually copied the data before deleting it. | Ransom,Databreach
Researchers from Fidelis Cybersecurity have also observed the Hadoop attacks and have published a blog post with more details and recommendations on securing such deployments. | O
