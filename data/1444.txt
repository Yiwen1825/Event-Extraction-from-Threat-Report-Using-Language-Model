Audit Finds Over a Dozen NTP Vulnerabilities | SecurityWeek.Com | DiscoverVulnerability
Researchers at Germany-based security firm Cure53 have conducted a 32-day audit of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and the NTPsec project and discovered more than a dozen vulnerabilities. | DiscoverVulnerability
Experts identified a total of 16 security-related issues, including 8 weaknesses that only affect NTP and two that only impact NTPsec, which is meant to be a secure, hardened and improved implementation of NTP. | DiscoverVulnerability
Cure53 has published separate reports focusing on the NTP and NTPsec problems. | DiscoverVulnerability
The Network Time Foundation addressed the flaws earlier this month with the release of ntp-4.2.8p10. | PatchVulnerability

CVE-2017-6460, which only affects NTP, has been described as a stack-based buffer overflow that can be triggered by a malicious server when a client requests the restriction list. | DiscoverVulnerability
The flaw can be exploited to cause a crash and possibly to execute arbitrary code. | DiscoverVulnerability
The security holes rated by Cure53 as high severity are CVE-2017-6463 and CVE-2017-6464, both of which can be exploited for DoS attacks. | DiscoverVulnerability
Itâ€™s worth noting that while some of the vulnerabilities have been classified as critical and high severity by Cure53, NTP developers have only assigned medium, low and informational-level severity ratings to the discovered flaws. | DiscoverVulnerability
Ntp-4.2.8p10 patches a total of 15 vulnerabilities and also includes just as many non-security fixes and improvements. | PatchVulnerability
Of the 15 security holes resolved in the latest version, 14 were discovered by Cure53, which also noticed that a flaw initially patched in December 2014 was reintroduced in November 2016. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
