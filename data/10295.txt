Cisco patches critical vulnerabilities in Policy Suite | PatchVulnerability
Cisco has resolved a set of critical vulnerabilities in Policy Suite which permit attackers to cause havoc in the software's databases. | PatchVulnerability
This week, the tech giant released a security advisory detailing four vulnerabilities which could place enterprise users at risk of information leaks, account compromise, database tampering, and more. | PatchVulnerability
The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-0374, has earned a CVSS base score of 9.8. | DiscoverVulnerability
Described as an unauthenticated bypass bug, the security flaw "could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect directly to the Policy Builder database," according to Cisco. | DiscoverVulnerability
The bug has been caused by a simple lack of authentication and as there is no requirement for identity verification, Policy Builder databases can be accessed and tampering with without limitation. | O
Cisco Policy Suite releases prior to 18.2.0 are affected. | DiscoverVulnerability
The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-0375, is a default password error. | DiscoverVulnerability
The CVSS 9.8 bug is present in the Cluster Manager of Cisco Policy Suite and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to a vulnerable system using a root account. | DiscoverVulnerability
The serious security problem has emerged due to the use of undocumented, static user credentials for root accounts. | DiscoverVulnerability
If a hacker has knowledge of these credentials, they can become a root user and are able to execute arbitrary commands. | O
Versions of the software prior to 18.2.0 are vulnerable to exploit. | DiscoverVulnerability
The third bug, CVE-2018-0376, is another unauthenticated access problem and is also caused by a lack of authentication measures. | DiscoverVulnerability
"A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make changes to existing repositories and create new repositories," Cisco says. | DiscoverVulnerability
Cisco Policy Suite versions prior to 18.2.0 are affected. | DiscoverVulnerability
The fourth security flaw, CVE-2018-0377, affects the Open Systems Gateway initiative (OSGi) interface of Cisco Policy Suite. | DiscoverVulnerability
There is a lack of authentication within the OSGi interface which permits attackers to circumvent security processes and directly connect to the interface, access any files contained within they wish, and modify any content which is accessible through the process. | DiscoverVulnerability
This vulnerability impacts Policy Suite versions prior to 18.1.0. | DiscoverVulnerability
There are no workarounds to circumvent these vulnerabilities. | O
However, patches have been issued to address them and Cisco says that no reports have been received which indicate the bugs are being exploited in the wild. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
In addition, Cisco has revealed seven now-patched bugs affecting SD-WAN solutions. | DiscoverVulnerability
The vulnerabilities included command injection security flaws, a remote code execution bug, and arbitrary file overwrite issues. | DiscoverVulnerability
