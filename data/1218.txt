He wrote on Three UK’s Facebook page: “Care to explain just how my details have been shared, how many people have had access to my personal information, for how long, and how many of your other customers have had their details leaked by yourselves to other members of the public as well?” | DiscoverVulnerability, Databreach
Other customers also wanted to know why they were being presented with other people’s information when they logged in. | Databreach
Three UK, which is owned by the telecoms giant Hutchinson and has 9 million customers in Britain, said it was investigating. | DiscoverVulnerability, Databreach
“We are aware of a small number of customers who may have been able to view the mobile account details of other Three users using My3,” a spokesman said. | DiscoverVulnerability, Databreach
