County rejected hacker ransom demand. Now they’re on the attack again. | AttackRansom
Cyber criminals took a second swing at Mecklenburg County government on Thursday after officials rejected a demand for money following a ransomware attack. | AttackRansom
The follow-up attempts to hold the county hostage over illegally encrypted data came just hours after County Manager Dena Diorio announced she’d decided against paying a hacker ransom. | AttackRansom
Instead of agreeing to pay criminals, she said Wednesday, the county will rebuild its system applications and restore files and data from backups. | AttackRansom
But by Thursday afternoon, hackers tried to strike again. | O
Diorio sent staff members an email saying, “I have a new warning for employees.” | O
As the county’s IT staff worked to recover from the first cyberattack, Diorio said, they discovered more attempts to compromise computers and data on Thursday. | AttackDatabreach
“To limit the possibility of a new infection, ITS is disabling employees’ ability to open attachments generated by DropBox and Google Documents,” she wrote in an email. | O
“The best advice for now is to limit your use of emails containing attachments, and try to conduct as much business as possible by phone or in person.” | O
She described the aftermath of the ransomware attack as a “crisis” and reassured employees they should not feel personally responsible for the incident. | AttackRansom
The county first learned of the problem earlier this week after an employee opened a malicious “phishing” email and accessed an attached file that unleashed a widespread problem inside the county’s network of computers and information technology. | AttackPhishing
The intent of that ransomware attack was to essentially access as many county government files and data servers as possible. | AttackRansom
Then, the information was encrypted or locked, keeping employees at the county from accessing operating systems and files. | AttackRansom
The person or people responsible for the infiltration then demanded the county pay two bitcoins, or about $23,000, in exchange for a release of the locked data. | AttackRansom
The county refused to pay. | AttackRansom
County officials say they anticipate the recovery time for Mecklenburg County government operations will take days. | O
“We are open for business, and we are slow, but there’s no indication of any data loss or that personal information was compromised,” Diorio said. | AttackDatabreach
Diorio said third-party security experts believe the attack earlier this week by a new strain of ransomware called LockCrypt originated from Iran or Ukraine. | AttackRansom
Forty-eight of about 500 county computer servers were affected. | O
