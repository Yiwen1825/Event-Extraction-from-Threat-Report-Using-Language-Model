WannaCry Remedies Are The Second Wave of Attacks
Since last Friday, over 200,000 victims in 150 countries have been hit by a massive, international ransomware cyberattack called WannaCry. | AttackRansom
Ransomware is a type of malware that works by seizing control of and blocking access to a computer’s files, programs, and operations.  | AttackRansom
Users are then informed that they must pay a certain amount in order to regain access to their files, with the threat of permanently losing all of their data if they choose not to pay.  | AttackRansom
In the WannaCry attack, users were given three days to make the payment before the fee increased, and seven days before the files would be lost forever. | AttackRansom
The massive scope and potential financial impact of the WannaCry attack has understandably caused a lot of panic, and companies and individuals alike have been rushing to protect their devices.  | AttackRansom
However, this frenzy has opened up new damaging routes for fraud. | O
One of these attack routes is through mobile applications that have been found on third-party application stores. | O
There are various mobile applications advertising that they can be used to protect users from the WannaCry ransomware. | O
However, our analysts found that some of these apps contained adware meant to infect the devices they are downloaded onto. | O
Rather than protecting users’ devices, they are causing them harm. | O

 The adware found is classified as Adware.mobidash, which is a module that attackers used to include into Android games and apps and monetize them. | O 
This adware has the capability to load webpages with ads, show other messages in the status bar, and modify the DNS server. | O
This is quite dangerous as the real risk lies in the fact that the end user’s device is performing unwanted activity without their authorization. | O
To hide this dangerous behavior, the adware doesn’t start to perform its malicious activity immediately; instead, it lies latent in the device before activating after a short period of time.
We have blogged a lot about digital trust, fake news, and all sorts of tricks that criminals use to get the attention of consumers to get them to click on a link. | AttackPhishing
Yet we continue to be amazed by how sophisticated the manipulation of the human factor has become. | O
It will only be a matter of time until we see the WannaCry malware expand further to trick end users into installing a patch that allegedly prevents the new massive ransomware attack. | AttackPhishing, AttackRansom, PatchVulnerability
However, this time it will not be a patch, but a new version or variant of a financially motivated malware. | O
