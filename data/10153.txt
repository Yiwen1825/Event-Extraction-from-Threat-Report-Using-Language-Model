Mozilla Patches Critical Code Execution Bug in Firefox 62 | PatchVulnerability
Mozilla released nine fixes in its Wednesday launch of Firefox 62 for Windows, Mac and Android – including one for a critical glitch that could enable attackers to run arbitrary code. | PatchVulnerability
Overall, the latest version of the Firefox browser included fixes for the critical issue, three high-severity flaws, two moderate problems and three low-severity vulnerabilities. | PatchVulnerability
 Topping the list is a memory safety bug (CVE-2018-12376), discovered by a number of Mozilla developers and community members. | DiscoverVulnerability
A critical impact bug means the vulnerability can be used to run attacker code and install software, requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing, according to Mozilla. | O
 The memory safety problem, which exists in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60, meets these criteria, researchers said. | DiscoverVulnerability
 Mozilla didn’t release further details, but it did assign one CVE to represent multiple similar issues. | DiscoverVulnerability
In addition to the memory safety bug(s), Mozilla also fixed three high-severity vulnerabilities in its latest update. | PatchVulnerability
These include a use-after-free glitch in refresh driver timers (CVE-2018-12377), which power browser-page refreshes. | PatchVulnerability
Another high-severity bug (CVE-2018-12378) is a use-after-free vulnerability that occurs when an IndexedDB index (a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data) is deleted while still in use by JavaScript code providing payload values. | DiscoverVulnerability
 “This results in a potentially exploitable crash,” the advisory said. | O
Mozilla developers and community members also found a memory-safety bug (CVE-2018-12375) in Firefox 61, which showed evidence of memory corruption and could be exploited to run arbitrary code, according to the advisory. | DiscoverVulnerability
The moderate and low-severity fixes that were deployed in Firefox 62 include patches for an out-of-bounds write flaw (triggered when the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file that contains a very long item filename); and a proxy bypass glitch in the browser’s proxy settings. | PatchVulnerability
Firefox 62 for desktop is available for download on Mozilla’s website. | PatchVulnerability
