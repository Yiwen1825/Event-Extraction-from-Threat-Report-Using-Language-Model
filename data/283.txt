There are several things that stand out about this threat. | O
The first is the humongous ransom demand it asks victims for, which is 545,000 Russian rubles (~$9,100). | AttackRansom
This ransom demand is between 10 and 100 times over the price of some phones, and most users who can't remove the screen locker will instead choose to buy a new phone rather than paying the crooks. | AttackRansom
To pay the ransom, victims have to enter their credit card number directly in the ransom screen, a technique very different from how other ransomware operators like to work, which is via Bitcoin, Tor, or gift cards. | AttackRansom
The other thing that sets this ransomware apart is the usage of the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) platform, now renamed in Firebase Cloud Messaging. | O
