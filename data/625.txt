He's experimented with a simulated water treatment system based on actual programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and documented how these can be hacked. | O
David Formby, a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, conducted his experiment to warn the industry about the danger of poorly-secured PLCs. | O
These small dedicated computers can be used to control important factory processes or utilities, but are sometimes connected to the internet. | O
For instance, Formby found that 1,500 of these industrial PLCs are accessible online, he said while speaking at the RSA cybersecurity conference on Monday. | O
It's not hard to imagine a hacker trying to exploit these exposed PLCs, he added. | O
Cybercriminals have been infecting businesses across the world with ransomware, a form of malware that can hold data hostage in exchange for bitcoin. | AttackRansom
For a hacker, holding an industrial control system hostage can also be lucrative, and far more devastating for the victim. | AttackRansom
“He (the hacker) can threaten to permanently damage this really sensitive equipment,” Formby said. | AttackRansom
In a month's time he developed a ransomware-like attack to control the PLCs to fill the storage tank with too much chlorine, making the water mix dangerous to drink. | O
Formby also managed to fool the surrounding sensors into thinking that clean water was actually inside the tank. | O
A hacker wanting to blackmail a water utility could take a same approach, and threaten to taint the water supply unless paid a ransom, he warned. | AttackRansom
Real-world water treatment systems are more sophisticated than the generic one he designed, Formby said. | O
However, poorly-secured PLCs are being used across every industry, including in oil and gas plants and manufacturing. | O
Most of these PLCs he found that were accessible online are located in the U.S., but many others were found in India and China, he said. | O
Formby recommends that industrial operators make sure they understand which systems connect to the internet, and who has control over them. | O
He’s also set up a company designed to help operators monitor for any malicious activity over their industrial control systems. | O
