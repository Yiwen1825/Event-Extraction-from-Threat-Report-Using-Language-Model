Phishing Email Response Compromises PHI of 2,800 Patients
A response to a phishing email has resulted in the PHI of 2,789 Kaleida Health patients being made accessible to cybercriminals. | AttackDatabreach
Kaleida Health discovered the attack on May 24, 2017, prompting a full investigation which involved hiring a third-party computer forensic firm. | O  
An analysis of its systems showed that by responding to the phishing email, the employee had provided access to his/her email account. | AttackDatabreach
While access to Kaleida Healthâ€™s EHR was not gained, the email account contained a range of protected health information of a small subset of its patients. | AttackDatabreach 
The types of data in the account varied for each patient, but may have included names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, diagnoses, treatment and other clinical data. | O 
However, no financial information or Social Security numbers were exposed at any time. | AttackDatabreach
While access to the email account was possible, no evidence was uncovered to suggest that the emails were accessed or any protected health information was viewed or copied. | AttackDatabreach 
However, since the possibility of data access could not be ruled out with a high degree of certainty, all affected patients have been notified of the incident by mail. | O
Phishing has grown to be one of the most serious threats to healthcare organizations. | AttackPhishing 
As we have already seen this year, record numbers of successful W-2 phishing attacks have been reported and many healthcare employees have fallen for these phishing scams. | AttackPhishing
Providing security awareness training to employees can help to reduce risk, although a single training session every year is no longer sufficient. | O 
Training must be an ongoing process. | O
