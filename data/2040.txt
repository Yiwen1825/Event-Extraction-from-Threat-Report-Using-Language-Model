Report: Average ransomware demand now over $1,000 | CSO Online | AttackRansom
The average amount of a ransomware demand has increased from $294 in 2015 to $1,077 last year, according to a report released last week by Symantec. | AttackRansom
"That's a pretty dramatic increase," said Kevin Haley, director of security response at Symantec. | O
"The bad guys can get almost anything they ask for," Haley said. | O
Some cybercriminals also adjust the size of the ransom demand to the type of victim, asking enterprises for significantly larger amounts of money than they do of consumers. | AttackRansom
The company also surveyed ransomware victims, and found that 34 percent of people paid the ransom globally. | AttackRansom
But in the U.S., the number was 64 percent. | O
All this money coming in is bad news for cybersecurity professionals. | O
"We're seeing a lot more people investing in this business, because it's highly profitable and it's really easy to get into," he said. | O
"The end result is more malware, and more ransomware. The problem will continue getting worse." The Internet of Things was also a major topic in the report. | O
Symantec operates an IoT honeypot, and the number of attacks nearly doubled over the course of 2016. | O
The intensity of attacks really surprised him, Haley said. | O
During peak activity, attacks would come in every two minutes. | O
That means that vulnerable devices would get infected almost as soon as they are connected to the internet, he said. | O
"If you plug it in, and decide to take care of security later, you're already too late." There's no grace period. | O
"But if the device is not using a default password, is patched, and is up to date, it can fight off most of those attacks," he said. | O
"Unfortunately, we know that there are a lot of devices out there with default passwords, or simple passwords, or haven't been patched." The 77-page report also covered a wide variety of other security-related topics. | O
One in 131 emails contained a malicious link or attachment, the highest rate in five years. | O
