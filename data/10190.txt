As reported by the Register, the user said: | O
    "Here is the alpc bug as 0day. | O
I don't f**king care about life anymore. | O
Neither do I ever again want to submit to MSFT anyway. | O
F**k all of this shit." | O
The user linked to a page on GitHub which appears to contain a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the vulnerability. | O
Following the disclosure, on Tuesday, Will Dormann, vulnerability analyst at CERT/CC verified the bug, adding that the zero-day flaw works "well in a fully-patched 64-bit Windows 10 system." | DiscoverVulnerability
The Windows vulnerability is described as a local privilege escalation security flaw in the Microsoft Windows task scheduler caused by errors in the handling of Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) systems. | DiscoverVulnerability
If exploited, the zero-day bug permits local users to obtain system privileges. | DiscoverVulnerability
As ALPC is a local system, the impact is limited, but the public disclosure of a zero-day is still likely a headache for the Redmond giant. | DiscoverVulnerability
There are no known workarounds for the vulnerability, which has been awarded a CVSS score of 6.4 -- 6.8. | O
SandboxEscaper's tweet has since been deleted. | O
However, Microsoft has acknowledged the zero-day flaw. | DiscoverVulnerability
This is likely to take place on September 11, the next scheduled Microsoft Patch Tuesday, unless the firm decides to issue an out-of-schedule patch. | PatchVulnerability
    "Windows has a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues, and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible. | O
Our standard policy is to provide solutions via our current Update Tuesday schedule." | O
