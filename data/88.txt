Researchers say that the email comes with two attachments. | O
A covering letter which is a standard PDF and an Excel file containing the GoldenEye variant of the Petya ransomware. | O
According to the blog, when the user opens the Excel file: “It contains a picture of a flower with the word “Loading…” underneath, and a text in German asking the victim to enable content so that the macros can run”. | O
Once enabled the macros begin encrypting the local user files before displaying the ransom note: “YOUR_FILES_ARE_ENCRYPTED.TXT” | O

Eventually the user is presented with a message telling them they are infected with the GoldenEye ransomware. | O
They are asked to download the Tor Browser and pay a ransom of at least 1.3 Bitcoin (BTC). | Ransom
