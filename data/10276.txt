Despite serious security flaws, D-Link will (again) not patch some routers | O
For the second time in roughly a year, D-Link has failed to act on warnings from security researchers involving the company’s routers. | DiscoverVulnerability
The latest incident arose after Silesian University of Technology researcher Błazej Adamczyk contacted D-Link last May about three vulnerabilities affecting eight router models. | DiscoverVulnerability
Following the warning, D-Link patched two of the affected routers, but did not initially reveal how it would proceed for the remaining six models. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
After further prompting from Adamczyk, D-Link revealed that the remaining six routers would not get a security patch because they were considered end-of-life models, leaving affected owners out in the cold. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
“The D-Link models affected are the DWR-116, DWR-140L, DWR-512, DWR-640L, DWR-712, DWR-912, DWR-921, and DWR-111, six of which date from 2013, with the DIR-640L first appearing in 2012 and the DWR-111 in 2014,” Naked Security reported. | DiscoverVulnerability
Though these are not current models in D-Link’s portfolio, many of the listed models are still likely to be in use. | O
As a result of this impasse, Adamczyk released details about the security flaws, following responsible security protocols after giving D-Link notice and the opportunity to address the issues. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
Of significance is that this is the second time in about a year that D-Link has failed to address security vulnerabilities affecting its products after being notified by researchers. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
The security researcher noted that the new flaw arose after D-Link reported that it had fixed a prior security flaw. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
Also known as “directory traversal” or “dot dot slash” attacks, these flaws allow a malicious attacker to gain access to system files with a simple HTTP request. | O
Despite D-Link’s spotty history with supporting older router models, the manufacturer is not alone in leaving routers unpatched. | PatchVulnerability
The American Consumer Institute reported that of the 186 routers it had tested, 155 contained firmware vulnerabilities. | DiscoverVulnerability
In total, ACI discovered more than 32,000 known vulnerabilities in its study. | DiscoverVulnerability
“Our analysis shows that, on average, routers contained 12 critical vulnerabilities and 36 high-risk vulnerabilities, across the entire sample,” ACI noted in its report. | DiscoverVulnerability
“The most common vulnerabilities were medium-risk, with an average of 103 vulnerabilities per router.” | O
For shoppers who are in the market for a new router, it’s probably best to also check with the manufacturer to see what the supported lifespan of the router is. | O
If the router is nearing its end of life, as in the case illustrated here, you may not get patches, regardless of how serious a security vulnerability may be. | PatchVulnerability
