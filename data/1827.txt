Some people might experience getting their driver’s license barcode scanned in places like pharmacies, retail shops, bars, casinos and others establishments that require it,” Trend Micro researchers explained. | AttackDatabreach
“Traditionally, PoS threats look for credit card mag stripe data and use other components such as keyloggers and backdoors to get other valuable information. | AttackDatabreach
RawPOS attempts to gather both in one go, cleverly modifying the regex string to capture the needed data.” | AttackDatabreach
This particular variant is geared towards collecting data from driver’s licenses issued in the US. | O
Thus, along with payment card data, criminals also get information such as the victims’ full name, date of birth, full address, gender, height, hair and eye color. | AttackDatabreach 
This additional info could definitely help criminals impersonate the card holder in many identity theft scenarios, as well as while effecting fraudulent card-not-present transactions. | O
RawPOS is one of the oldest known Point-of-Sale RAM scraper malware families. | O
It’s first incarnation was spotted all the way back in 2009. | O
