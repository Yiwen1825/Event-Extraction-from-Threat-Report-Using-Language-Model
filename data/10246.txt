Cyber attack on CDOT computers estimated to cost up to $1.5 million so far
Six weeks after ransomware forced Colorado Department of Transportation’s back-end operations offline, the agency is back to 80 percent functionality — at an estimated cost of up to $1.5 million, according to the state. | O
Colorado officials said they never caved to the attacker’s demands to pay bitcoin in order to recover encrypted computer files. | AttackRansom
But clearing each computer took time and additional resources — including the Colorado National Guard — to investigate, contain and recover. | O
“We were able to recover from the SamSam attack relatively quickly due to our robust backup plan and our segmentation strategies,” Brandi Simmons, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Office of Information Technology, said in an email. | O 
“We are still capturing costs associated with the incident, but our estimate is between $1M and $1.5M.” | O
What started with a core team of 25 IT employees, Simmons said, ballooned to 150  “during the peak of the incident” — March 2-9. | O
She added that others included CDOT, the FBI, state emergency operations and private companies. | O
The million-dollar estimate includes only overtime pay and other unexpected costs. | O
The state’s new backup system prevented data loss, but personal data on employees’ computers may not be recovered. | O
The cyberattack started around Feb 21 when a variant of the SamSam ransomware hijacked CDOT computer files. | O
CDOT shut down more than 2,000 computers. | O
Its employees had to use personal devices to check email. | O
The state did not share the value of bitcoin that attackers demanded. | AttackRansom
Elsewhere, SamSam attacked the city of Atlanta, debilitating computer systems that residents used to pay traffic tickets, report potholes and access Wi-Fi at the airport. | O
The city hasn’t issued a public update since March 30, and a city spokesman said Thursday there is nothing new to share. | O
Attackers demanded $51,000 worth of bitcoin. | AttackRansom
Asked whether Atlanta has paid the ransom, spokeswoman Anne Torres said: “Unfortunately, we cannot comment further on the ransom.”| AttackRansom
The rise of ransomware attacks has caused some to wonder whether it’s worth paying to avoid business outages — Hancock Health in Indiana paid $55,000 to get its files back. | AttackRansom
Dan Likarish, a computer professor at Denver’s Regis University, said there’s still a good reason not to do it. | O
“If you pay the ransom, you’re supporting the criminal,” said Likarish, adding there’s also no guarantee the attacker will return computer files intact. | AttackRansom
“The weasel answer? It’s a risk mitigation. | O
That’s the way we label ourselves. | O
We talk to upper management, present the business case that we’ve identified the problem, let’s just pay. | O
That’s what a lot of hospitals have done. | O
It’s not unusual to pay for the key and go about your business. | O
It depends on how sophisticated your security staff is. | O
If you don’t have it, what do you do? You’ve got to keep things running.” | O
Likarish said he was able to help with efforts to contain the CDOT attack and was in awe at how the state’s IT office swooped in and took command. | O
While IT staff had already updated its own computer operations, not every state agency is on the same system, including CDOT. | O
“People are listening to them now,” Likarish said. | O
