Airmail issues fix for security flaw that could let hackers read your email | PatchVulnerability
Airmail has issued an update today to patch a vulnerability that security researchers said could let malicious third parties access email databases and read a user’s messages. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
Security consulting firm Versprite outlined the issue in a blog post this morning, noting how Airmail 3 uses both a custom URL scheme and a so-called “deterministic” file system location for email messages for any given account. | DiscoverVulnerability
 Using those two pieces of information, a hacker could theoretically retrieve every one of a user’s messages through a phishing scheme that relies on that custom URL scheme. | AttackPhishing
Airmail told The Verge that it’s already updated the app in the Mac App store and through its direct download beta program to address the issue, calling it a “very hypothetical” one. | PatchVulnerability
 The version number is Airmail 3.6, and it should be rolling out over the course of the day if you don’t already have it now. | PatchVulnerability
 The update is also listed on Airmail’s website, with the update note, “Potential URL Scheme Vulnerability Fix.” | O
