Sabre hires Mandiant to probe breach in hotel reservation system | Reuters
(Reuters) - Sabre Corp said on Tuesday there had been a breach in its hospitality unit’s hotel reservation system and had hired FireEye Inc’s Mandiant forensics division to probe the incident. | O
"The unauthorized access has been shut off and there is no evidence of continued unauthorized activity," Sabre said in a statement. | O
The company, which offers hotel and airline booking services, said it had informed law enforcement about the breach in its SynXis Central Reservations. | O
Sabre does not believe any other system was affected. | O
“32,000 properties use Sabre’s reservation system, so the attackers were able to penetrate a single system and potentially access 32,000 additional targets,” said Jeff Hill, Director of Product Management, Prevalent, which manages third-party risk.
