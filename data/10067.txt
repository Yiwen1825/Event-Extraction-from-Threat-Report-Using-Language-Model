 Google and Facebook duped in huge 'scam'   
Google and Facebook have confirmed that they fell victim to an alleged $100m (Â£77m) scam. | O
In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against "two US-based internet companies" that were not named at the time. | AttackPhishing
They had allegedly been tricked into wiring more than $100m to the alleged scammer's bank accounts. | AttackPhishing
On 27 April, Fortune reported that the two victims were Facebook and Google. | O
The man accused of being behind the scam, Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, allegedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the companies from at least 2013 until 2015. | AttackPhishing 
"Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company," the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in March. | AttackPhishing
These emails purported to be from employees of the Asia-based firm, the DOJ alleged, and were sent from email accounts designed to look like they had come from the company, but in fact had not. | AttackPhishing
The DOJ also accused Mr Rimasauskas of forging invoices, contracts and letters "that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies". | AttackPhishing
"We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities," a spokeswoman for Google said in a statement. | AttackPhishing
"We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved." | O
However, the firm did not reveal how much money it had transferred and recouped. | O
Nor did Facebook - but a spokeswoman said: "Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation." | O
