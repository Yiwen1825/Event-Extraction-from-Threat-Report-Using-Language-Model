A woman who lost HK$119,000 in 24 hours was among almost 250 people duped out of about HK$1.9 million (US$242,000) in a WhatsApp scam in Hong Kong this year, police said on Wednesday. | AttackPhishing
According to police, swindlers pretended to be friends of WhatsApp users and invented different excuses to lure them into revealing their account verification codes. | AttackPhishing
The con men then accessed the accounts with the codes and, posing as the users, sent text messages to deceive the account holders’ contacts. | AttackPhishing
Mohammed said genuine account holders were unable to use WhatsApp at least 12 hours after their accounts were hijacked. | O
“All the scam victims were asked to buy MyCard points cards for online games,” he said. | O
MyCard is a digital payment platform. | O
Users can buy credit to spend on the platform from convenience stores across the city, Mohammed said. | O
After getting passwords for the cards, scammers sold them online. | O
Police said the age range of the victims was between 17 and 72 and losses went from a few hundred dollars to thousands. | O
No arrests had been made. | O
The Post reported in February that officers believed fraudsters from Taiwan were behind the scam because the points cards they requested were used for the Taiwanese versions of online games. | O
Police advised residents to safeguard their personal data and verify the identity of those who contact them. | O
If in doubt, people should call the Anti-Scam Helpline at 18222. | O
