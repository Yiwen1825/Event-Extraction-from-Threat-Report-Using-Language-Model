GREENFIELD — Hancock Health paid a $55,000 ransom to hackers to regain access to its computer systems, hospital officials said. | Ransom
Part of the health network had been held hostage since late Thursday, when ransomware locked files including patient medical records. | Ransom
The hackers targeted more than 1,400 files, the names of every one temporarily changed to “I’m sorry.” | O
They gave the hospital seven days to pay or the files would be permanently encrypted, officials said. | Ransom
An analysis since the attack confirmed no personal patient information was taken by the hackers, believed to be located in eastern Europe, said Hancock Health CEO Steve Long. | Databreach
The affected files were backed up and could have been recovered, but restoring them would take days — maybe even weeks — and would be costly, Long said. | O
From a business standpoint, paying a small ransom made more sense, he said. | Ransom
The hacker asked for four bitcoins — a virtual currency used to make anonymous transactions that are nearly impossible to trace. | Ransom  
At the time of the transfer, those four bitcoins were valued at about $55,000. | O
