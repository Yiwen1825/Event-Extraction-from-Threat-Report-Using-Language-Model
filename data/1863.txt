“We identified more than six billion attempted attacks over the 12-month period – that’s around 16 million attacks a day – and monitored threat actors using nearly every type of attack,” said Steven Bullitt, Vice President Threat Intelligence & Incident Response, GTIC, NTT Security. | O
With visibility into 40 percent of the world’s internet traffic, NTT Security summarizes data from over 3.5 trillion logs and 6.2 billion attacks for the 2017 Global Threat Intelligence Report (GTIR).  | O
Analysis is based on log, event, attack, incident and vulnerability data. | O
