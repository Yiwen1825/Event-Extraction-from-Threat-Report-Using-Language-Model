 'Shark Tank's' Robert Herjavec: Here's how hackers use bitcoin against you  
Although Robert Herjavec, an investor on ABC's "Shark Tank," expects the price of bitcoin to "skyrocket," he has no plans to personally buy any. | O
That's because as the CEO of cybersecurity firm Herjavec Group, he doesn't want to support the growing trend of hackers using cryptocurrency. | O
"I can't invest in something that my enemy uses as funds," he explained on CNBC's "Squawk Alley." | O
Indeed, "If there was no cryptocurrency, much of the large hacks that we're seeing today wouldn't exist," Herjavec told Money. | O
As one example, Herjavec is concerned with the role cryptocurrency plays in ransomware attacks. | AttackRansom
"Cryptocurrency permits anonymity," he explains to CNBC Make It. | O
 "It's a very popular form of payment for ransomware in particular." | O
Ransomware is a type of software that locks or encrypts a computer user's data and files, in affect holding it hostage. | AttackRansom
 To release the information, a hacker will demand a ransom payment. | O
Ransomware attacks increased 6,000 percent in 2016 from 2015, according to a study from IBM Security. | AttackRansom
 And in 2017, 200,000 computers in 150 countries belonging to businesses, governments and even the U.K. | O
 National Health Service were impacted by the ransomware virus known as WannaCry. | AttackRansom
 In that case, victims were told to make a payment in bitcoin to get their computers back. | AttackRansom
Hackers often demand the ransom be paid in cryptocurrency because it allows them to remain anonymous, Herjavec says. | AttackRansom
 "I can take over your computer or personal information, hold it for ransom, give you instructions on how to create a virtual wallet, force you to pay me, and you have no way of finding out who I am," Herjavec explains. | AttackRansom
That's because a bitcoin wallet is only identified by a number, and "payments are direct without a bank or credit card company acting as the middle man," Herjavec says. | 
 "There is no money trail, so it's very difficult to track back to an individual." | O
With WannaCry, the hackers asked for $300 worth of bitcoin from victims, and if they waited over 72 hours to pay, the fine increased to $600. | AttackRansom
 If they waited a week, their information would be locked for good. | O
 The Trump administration pointed to North Korea as the originator of the attack. | O
In 2016, ransomware was used to coerce Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, a hospital in Los Angeles, to pay 40 bitcoin to hackers, The New York Times reports. | AttackRansom
 That sum was then worth $17,000. | O
 Bitcoin closed at $10,779.90 on Tuesday, March 6, according to CoinMarketCap, which makes those 40 coins worth about $431,196. | O
To protect yourself from ransomware attacks, take steps to secure your online information. | AttackRansom
"Keep your computer and data safe by backing up often, using cloud services with dual factor authentication and complex passwords," Herjavec suggests. | O
 "Have anti-virus [software] installed and kept up to date." | O
