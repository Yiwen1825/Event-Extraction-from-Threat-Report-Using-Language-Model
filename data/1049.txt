Pre-installed malware stealing data from mobiles: Check Point | InfotechLead | AttackDatabreach
Israel-based cyber security firm Check Point has detected a malware that is not downloaded due to users’ use but is already present in Android device. | O
According to a company blog post last week, the pre-installed malware was detected in 38 Android devices, belonging to a large telecommunications company and a multinational technology company. | O
“The malicious apps were not part of the official ROM supplied by the vendor, and were added somewhere along the supply chain,” the company said. | O
The malware added to the devices’ ROM could not be removed by the users, therefore, the devices had to be re-flashed. | O
The research team at Check Point found that one of the pre-installed malwares was Slocker, a mobile ransomware, that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm to encrypt all files on the device and demand ransom in return for their decryption key. | AttackRansom
“The most notable rough adnet which targeted the devices is the Loki Malware. | O
This complex malware operates by using several different components; each has its own functionality and role in achieving the malware’s malicious goal,” the cyber security firm said. | O
Pre-installed malwares steal data from the devices and are installed to system, taking full control of the device. | AttackDatabreach
The cyber security firm suggested users to protect themselves from regular and pre-installed malware by implementing advanced security measures capable of identifying and blocking any abnormality in the device’s behaviour. | O
