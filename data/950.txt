Report: Democrat Groups Paid Ransoms to Hide Protester Funding – Tennessee Star | AttackRansom

Many of the Trump protesters during the runup to the November election and after were not spontaneous citizens airing their grievances but were paid professionals. | O

But the protesters weren’t the only ones who got paid…others who threatened to disclose these facts got paid $30,000 or up, to as much as $150,000 for their silence. | O
By Democrat groups who funded the protests, of course. | O
Or by paying the “ransom” did the Democrats actually secure the release of some child kidnapped by the Russians? | AttackRansom
