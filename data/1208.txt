McShame: McDonald's API Leaks Data for 2.2 Million Users
Things are getting messy at McDonald's in India, and that's not just for consumers of the Maharaja Mac - a double-stacked grilled chicken monstrosity with jalapenos and habanero sauce. | Databreach
The flaw, found by payments company Fallible, exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses and sometimes the coordinates of those homes, as well as links to social media profiles. | Databreach, DiscoverVulnerability
And Fallible contends that the leak still hasn't been properly fixed. | Databreach, DiscoverVulnerability, Databreach
I queried McDonald's to see if it has tried to seal the hole in the API and also whether it has notified customers or regulators, but I didn't get an immediate response. | Databreach, PatchVulnerability
In a March 19 tweet, McDonald's didn't issue any clear answers, instead taking the well-trodden path of seeking to reassure users by highlighting what was not breached. | Databreach, PatchVulnerability
McDonald's has dabbled in home delivery in many countries since the early 1990s, attracting budget diners willing to risk the short half-life of its sandwiches and fries versus the vagaries of home delivery. | Databreach, PatchVulnerability
Fallible says it contacted McDonald's India on Feb 7, letting the fast-food chain know it could sequentially pull user information from the API using a curl request. | Databreach, PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
"An unprotected publicly accessible API endpoint for getting user details coupled with serially enumerable integers as customer IDs can be used to obtain access to all users personal information," Fallible writes in a blog post. | Databreach, PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
But the issue appeared to remain unfixed, so Fallible says McDonald's another email on March 7 asking for a status update. | Databreach, PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
Ten days later, it sent another email and received no response. | Databreach, PatchVulnerability
Fallible chose to go public with the issue in a March 18 blog post, prompting a public acknowledgement from McDonald's on Twitter the next day. | Databreach, PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
Fallible contends the issue hasn't been fixed, and it's unclear from McDonald's tweet if it was. | Databreach, PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
India doesn't have a specific law that requires mandatory reporting of data breaches. | Databreach
But there are regulations and laws that cover the disclosure of personal information. | O
