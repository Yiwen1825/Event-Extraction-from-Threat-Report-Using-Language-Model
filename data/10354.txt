Multiple Critical Security Vulnerabilities Discovered In Linux Systemd
Researchers have discovered some serious security flaws threatening Linux. | DiscoverVulnerability
These vulnerabilities exist in Linux systemd component. | DiscoverVulnerability
According to the researchers, the vulnerabilities pose a risk to all systemd-based Linux distros. | DiscoverVulnerability
Allegedly, researchers at Qualys have disclosed some bugs targeting the Linux systemd component. | DiscoverVulnerability
Systemd provides the core building blocks for Linux and handles major processes after booting. | O
As revealed, three vulnerabilities have targeted the systemd-journald, which is responsible for data collection and log storage. | DiscoverVulnerability
The vulnerabilities let an attacker gain root privileges on the target device. | DiscoverVulnerability
The researchers state that these vulnerabilities threaten all Linux distros based on systemd except a few. | DiscoverVulnerability
As stated in their report, “To the best of our knowledge, all systemd-based Linux distributions are vulnerable, but SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, openSUSE Leap 15.0, and Fedora 28 and 29 are not exploitable because their user space is compiled with GCC’s -fstack-clash-protection.”| DiscoverVulnerability
The three bugs include two different memory corruption flaws (CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865), and an out-of-bounds flaw (CVE-2018-16866). | DiscoverVulnerability
At first, the researchers accidentally discovered CVE-2018-16864 while working on an exploit for a previously disclosed vulnerability, Mutagen Astronomy. | DiscoverVulnerability
Then, when they were busy on its PoC, they spotted the other two bugs. | DiscoverVulnerability
    “We developed a proof of concept for CVE-2018-16864 that gains eip control on i386… We developed an exploit for CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 that obtains a local root shell in 10 minutes on i386 and 70 minutes on amd64, on average.” | DiscoverVulnerability
Interestingly, the bugs had been around for quite a few years. | O
For now, Red Hat has patched the bugs CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865. | PatchVulnerability
Whereas, Debian has fixed CVE-2018-16866 in the unstable systemd 240-1 release. | PatchVulnerability
Other distros will also supposedly release the fixes soon. | PatchVulnerability
In November 2018, a Google researcher also highlighted a critical flaw in Systemd that induced system crashes and hacks. | DiscoverVulnerability
