The Indiana Department of Revenue (DOR) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are warning folks of fraudulent emails impersonating either revenue agency and encouraging individuals to open files corrupted with malware. | AttackPhishing

This well-known malware, known as Emotet, generally poses as specific banks or financial institutions to trick individuals into opening infected documents. | AttackPhishing

Emotet is known to constantly evolve, and in the past few weeks has masqueraded as the IRS, pretending to be “IRS Online.” The scam email includes an attachment labeled “Tax Account Transcript” or something similar, with the subject line often including “tax transcript.” | AttackPhishing
Both DOR and IRS have several tips to help individuals and businesses not fall prey to email scams: | O
Remember, DOR and the IRS do not contact customers via email to share sensitive documents such as a tax transcript. | O
Use security software to protect against malware and viruses, and be sure it’s up-to-date. | O
Never open emails, attachments or click on links when you’re not sure of the source. | O
