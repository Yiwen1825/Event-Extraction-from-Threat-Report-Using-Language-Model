Hackers are attacking Word users with new Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability | ZDNet
The bug affects all supported versions of Microsoft Word, but will be fixed this week. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
Unlike most document-related vulnerabilities, this zero-day bug that has yet to be patched doesn't rely on macros -- in which Office typically warns users of risks when opening macro-enabled files. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
Instead, the vulnerability is triggered when a victim opens a trick Word document, which downloads a malicious HTML application from a server, disguised to look like a Rich Text document file as a decoy. | AttackPhishing
The HTML application meanwhile downloads and runs a malicious script that can be used to stealthily install malware. | AttackPhishing
Researchers at McAfee, who first reported the discovery on Friday, said because the HTML application is executable, the attacker can run code on the affected computer while evading memory-based mitigations designed to prevent these kinds of attacks. | DiscoverVulnerability
The issue relates to the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) function, which allows an application to link and embed content to other documents, according to researchers. | O
The Windows OLE feature is used primarily in Office and Windows' in-built document viewer WordPad, but has been the cause of numerous vulnerabilities over the past few years. | O
The researchers recently focused a Black Hat talk on the Windows OLE attack surface. | O
The bug can be exploited on all versions of Office, including the latest Office 2016 running on Windows 10, and have spotted attacks in the wild since January. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the company will issue a fix for the bug on Tuesday as part of its monthly release of security fixes and patches. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
