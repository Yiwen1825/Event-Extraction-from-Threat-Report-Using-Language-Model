Microsoft shrugs off report that Edge can expose user identities from JS Fetch requests • The Register | AttackDatabreach
Updated An independent researcher claims to have uncovered a security flaw in Microsoft Edge. | DiscoverVulnerability
The issue enables any website to identify someone by their username from another website, according to Ariel Zelivansky. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
More specifically, the researcher alleges that Edge exposes the URL of any JavaScript Fetch response, contrary to the specification. | DiscoverVulnerability
This poses a problem because a crafted fetch request on a webpage can redirect to a URL containing the visitor's username (e.g., requesting https://facebook.com/me will pull in https://facebook.com/username). | DiscoverVulnerability
Zelivansky notified Microsoft, but the company stated the issue was not a security problem. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
El Reg sought additional comment from Microsoft but was informed that the company had nothing further to add beyond its initial response to Zelivansky. | O
The researcher publicized his findings and informed The Reg earlier this month after Microsoft decided against issuing a security fix for the issue. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
The privacy concern sparked a discussion thread on Reddit. ® | O
Despite Microsoft assigning an engineer to investigate, they continue to classify the matter as not a security vulnerability. | O
