On Thursday, the Shadow Brokers dumped them online after an attempt to sell these and other supposedly Windows and Unix hacking tools for bitcoin. | Databreach
The Shadow Brokers made news back in August when they dumped hacking tools for routers and firewall products that they claimed came from the Equation Group, a top cyberespionage team that some suspect works for the NSA. | Databreach
Those tools contained several previously unknown and valuable exploits, lending credibility to the hacking group's claims, according to security researchers. | O 
The Shadow Brokers' latest dump includes 61 files, many of which have never been seen by security firms before, said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition InfoSec, a security provider. | Databreach
He’s been examining the tools, and said it’ll take time to verify their capabilities. | O 
His initial view is that they’re designed for detection evasion. | O 
For instance, one of the tools is built to edit Windows event logs. | O 
Potentially, a hacker could use the tool to selectively delete notifications and alerts in the event logs, preventing the victim from realizing they’ve been breached, he said. | O 
“If you simply remove a record or two, then even an organization that is following the best security practices, presumably, wouldn’t notice the change,” he said. | O 
On Thursday, the Shadow Brokers said they released the Windows hacking tools for free because a Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus product could already flag them as harmful. | O 
The clandestine group previously tried to auction off a whole set of hacking tools for 1 million bitcoins or what was at the time US$584 million. | O 
But after several months, that auction only managed to generate 10 bitcoins. | O 
“Despite theories, it always being about bitcoins for TheShadowBrokers,” the group said in broken English in their supposed final message. | O 
However, Williams believes the Shadow Brokers are likely spies working for the Russian government. | O 
This latest dump was a message to the U.S, he said. | O 
In recent weeks, U.S. intelligence agencies have been claiming the Kremlin tried to influence the U.S. election. | O 
Based on those findings, President Barack Obama has already ordered sanctions against Russia and vowed covert action. | O 
“If they are Russian, this is a shot across the bow,” Williams said. | O 
It’s unclear how the Shadow Brokers managed to steal the hacking tools. | Databreach
The group has said their arsenal of supposed Linux and Windows-based hacking tools is still up for sale at 10,000 bitcoins. | O 
On Thursday, Microsoft said it's investigating this latest batch of hacking tools that have been released. | O
