Windows security: Microsoft issues fix for critical Docker tool flaw, so patch now | PatchVulnerability
 Microsoft has released a patch for a critical remote code execution flaw affecting a Windows service used for importing Docker container images. | PatchVulnerability, DiscoverVulnerability
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-201808115, is due to the Windows Host Compute Service Shim (hcsshim) library not properly validating input from container images while importing them. | DiscoverVulnerability
A remote attacker could execute malware on a Windows host using a malicious Docker container image if they managed to trick an authenticated administrator to import it in Docker for Windows, which uses the hcsshim library. | AttackRansom
"An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the host operating system," Microsoft notes in its advisory. | DiscoverVulnerability
The vulnerability hasn't been publicly disclosed. | DiscoverVulnerability
 Anyone using Docker for Windows can resolve the issue today by installing version 0.6.10 of hcsshim. | PatchVulnerability
The patch is available from Microsoft's security advisory or from Microsoft's GitHub page. | PatchVulnerability
Hcsshim, which is written in Go, is an open-source wrapper that Microsoft developed for use with its Host Compute Service, a container management API in Windows Hyper-V virtualization for Docker. | O
The HCS abstraction layer is Microsoft's way of allowing Docker containers to use Linux kernel features on Windows, such as Linux Namespaces and Control Groups. | O
Hanselmann explains that the flaw stems from hccshim's use of a function from Go and the failure to sanitize input from an imported container image. | O
"Its use of Go's filepath.Join function with unsanitized input [made it possible] to create, remove and replace files in the host file system, leading to remote code execution," he noted. | O
"Importing a Docker container image or pulling one from a remote registry isn't commonly expected to make modifications to the host file system outside the Docker-internal data structures." | O
Separately, Microsoft is reportedly working on a fix for a "fatal flaw" in its initial Windows 10 fix for the Meltdown CPU vulnerability. | PatchVulnerability
It's been patched in the new Windows 10 April 2018 Update, according to Alex Ionescu, chief architect at Crowdstrike, but hasn't been backported to previous versions of Windows 10. | PatchVulnerability
