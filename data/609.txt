Islamic State supporters hit by Android malware on Telegram - CyberScoop
 
 

Islamic State supporters are warning one another of malware targeting the militant group through the chat app Telegram. | O
One member on a popular ISIS forum alerted users to plus_gram.apk, a trojanized RAT (a remote access tool disguised as harmless software) that allows an attacker to spy on and take full control of the target’s Android device. | AttackPhishing
The ISIS supporter used malware analysis at NVISIO, a popular free platform to test Android software for malicious code. | O
The warning was first spotted and described by @switch_d, a veteran ISIS watcher. | O
This attack arrives as a phishing link disguised as an invitation to a video chat, according to the warning, a tactic ISIS supporters have fallen victim to in the past. | AttackPhishing
The responses to the warning include a thanks and common sense guidance to “only accept files from brothers you know”. | O
This malware runs in multiple stages, Khalil Sehnaoui, a Middle East-based cybersecurity specialist and founder of Krypton Security, told CyberScoop. | O
“The exploit code is usually small and after successful exploitation it runs a dropper code which will in turn download new applications/malware in order to get more control of the system by escalating privileges”. | O
