VILLAGE OF NASHOTAH - The village recently paid an unidentified hacker a $2,000 ransom to decrypt its computer system after a hack in late November that left some residents' personal information exposed. | AttackDatabreach
Village President Richard Lartz said Thursday, Dec 7, that the hack "totally encrypted" Nashotah's computer files, making them inaccessible to staff. | O
He said the only information that was exposed during the breach were citizens' names and driver's license numbers, and possibly their addresses. | AttackDatabreach
Social Security numbers and other sensitive information was not compromised. | AttackDatabreach
"The only information that got out was voter rolls," Lartz said, emphasizing that neither he nor village staff know whether that information was used or dispersed by the hacker. | AttackDatabreach
