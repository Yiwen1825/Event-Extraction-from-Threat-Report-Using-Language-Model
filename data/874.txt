Cloudflare chief pledges third-party review of code – Naked Security | O
Bad as Cloudbleed is, there’s no evidence attackers exploited it before the patch was deployed. | DiscoverVulnerability,PatchVulnerability
But since the vulnerability was triggered more than 1.2m times from 6,500 sites, Cloudflare is taking no chances: the company has tapped an outside company, Veracode, to scour its code. | O
CEO Matthew Prince pledged the external review as he set out a detailed update after 12 days of investigation. | O
That update includes a synopsis of how the vulnerability was created and who faced the most risk. | O
He said Cloudflare continues to work with Google and others to eliminate all leaked data from memory: | O
We’ve successfully removed more than 80,000 unique cached pages. | O
That underestimates the total number because we’ve requested search engines purge and re-crawl entire sites in some instances. | O
Cloudbleed is a serious vulnerability in Cloudflare’s internet infrastructure that Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered in mid-February. | DiscoverVulnerability
It turned out that a single character in Cloudflare’s code caused the problem. | O
In its initial blog post on the matter, Cloudflare said the issue stemmed from its decision to use a new HTML parser called cf-html. | O
In his update, Prince said Cloudbleed was triggered when a page with two characteristics was requested through Cloudflare’s network. | O
