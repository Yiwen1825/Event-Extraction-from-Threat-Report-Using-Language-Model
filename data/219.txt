Mere days after thousands of MongoDB databases were hit by ransomware attacks, cybercriminals have set their sights on ElasticSearch servers, according to reports. | Ransom
Hackers have reportedly hijacked insecure servers exposed to the internet with weak and easy-to-guess passwords. | Ransom
ElasticSearch is a Java-based search engine, commonly used by enterprises for information cataloguing and data analysis. | O
According to security researcher Niall Merrigan, who has been monitoring the attacks, the cybercriminals are currently closing in on around 3,000 ElasticSearch servers. | Ransom
Merrigan told IBTimes UK: "We found the first one on the 12th of Jan and then started tracking the different IOCs (Indicators Of Compromise). | O
The first actor has levelled off and looks like it has stopped. | O
However, a second and third actor have joined in and are continuing to compromise servers. | O
"Attackers are finding open servers where there is no authentication at all. | O
This can be done via a number of services and tools. | O
Unfortunately, system admins and developers have been leaving these unauthenticated systems online for a while and attackers are just picking off the low hanging fruit right now." | O
The recent MongoDB attacks saw hackers demand ransom and erasing data to ensure victims' compliance. | Ransom
In the ongoing ElasticSearch attacks, the cybercriminals demand a ransom of 0.2 Bitcoins, according to a report by BleepingComputer. | Ransom
However, according to Merrigan, $20,000 in Bitcoins have already been paid by victims of the MongoDB attack. | Ransom
Despite paying the ransom, the victims have not received their data back. | Ransom
"So in this case it is a scam," the researcher said. | O
