InfoSec Handlers Diary Blog - Dynamite Phishing | AttackPhishing
Last week I ran across a very successful phishing campaign, what’s odd in most ways it was nothing special. | AttackPhishing
The attacker was using this more like a worm, where stolen credentials would be used within the hour to start sending out a mass amount of more phishes. | AttackPhishing , AttackDatabreach
I've decided to call this "Dynamite Phishing" because there is nothing quiet about this at all. | AttackPhishing
It seems about 40% of the credentials were used for more mailings, and the other account's credentials had not been used. | O
The initial phishes came in from a K12 domain from several affected individuals. | AttackPhishing
The email subject was  “You have an Incoming Document Share With You Via Google Docs”. | O
The contents of the email were base64 encoded, while it appears to be common Content-Transfer-Encoding, it's not something I typically run into especially when looking at Phishes. | O
The link in the document went to "hxxp://bit.ly/2kZJbW3" which went to hxxp://jamesrichardsquest.co.nf/lib | O
The landing page was setup as a generic Outlook Web Access 2013 login page. | O
It appears the EM_Client is a pretty popular email client, but it maybe something you can block on depending on your environment. | O
user-agent: eM_Client/7.0.27943.0 | O
While most people have good protections from Emails coming from external entities into their email environment, many don’t push the same protections intra-domain. | O
The volume of email sent from the Phished accounts to other Internal accounts is what made this so successful. | AttackPhishing
