Twitter Accidentally Made Half a Million People Follow Trump - Motherboard | O
Approximately 560,000 people were affected by a flaw in the script used to migrate followers to the new archival handles. | DiscoverVulnerability
"If you were following @POTUS before 12pET, by end of day you'd be following *two* accounts: @POTUS44 (44th Admin) and @POTUS (45th Admin)," Dorsey tweeted. | O
Dorsey apologized for the mistake, and said Twitter has worked to correct the issue. | DiscoverVulnerability
He did add, however, that the Obama Administration felt it was fair to automatically migrate followers after the transition, since @POTUS is an institutional account. | O
One of the most visible transfers of executive power happened today on Twitter. | O
The official @POTUS account was handed off to President Trump, and former-President Obama re-assumed his personal handle, @BarackObama. | O
(Trump predictably continued to tweet from his personal account long into the inauguration, however.) | O
Michelle and I are off on a quick vacation, then we'll get back to work. | O
But some Twitter users are complaining that despite never following @POTUS in the first place, the presidential handle is suddenly showing up in their timelines. | O
Somehow, they claim, Twitter had automatically followed it for them. | O

"I specifically UNFOLLOWED this account earlier today. | O
Yet now I am following it again without having resubscribed," one user tweeted. | O
"@POTUS turned up in my feed despite me not following, willingly or otherwise," said another person. | O
A spokesperson for Twitter told Motherboard they couldn't comment on these specific claims, but said that post-inauguration, Twitter automatically migrated the followers of @POTUS over to the newly created @POTUS44 account, which acts as an archive for President Obama's tweets. | O
The same was done for @FLOTUS44, belonging to Michelle Obama, and @VP44, belonging to former-Vice President Biden. | O
As you can see, both versions have somewhat similar follower counts. | O
