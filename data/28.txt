How to tell if your Snapchat has been hacked, and how to get it back | O
As of June 2016,  more than 150 million active users interact with one another daily via Snapchat. | O
Others are drawn by the service's more recent features. | O
Those include Snapcash, a method introduced for users to send mobile payments to their friends. | O
Given the app's popularity, it's no wonder online criminals have set their sights on hacking users' Snapchat accounts. | O
For instance, back in late 2013, a group of hackers published a database containing the usernames and phone numbers of approximately 4.6 million Snapchat users. | AttackDatabreach
Nefarious individuals could have used that information to profile targets across multiple web accounts. | O
We also can't forget about the security incident that occurred back in February 2016. | AttackPhishing
In that attack, someone posed as the company's CEO and convinced a Snapchat employee to send over payroll information. | AttackPhishing
The successful phish ultimately compromised dozens of employees' identities. | AttackPhishing , AttackDatabreach
To be fair, a mega breach on the scale of what affected LinkedIn, Tumblr, and Yahoo has yet to strike the messaging app. | AttackPhishing
But that's not to say criminals aren't trying to find a way into people's accounts. | O
Hackers clearly have Snapchat in their sights, which is why users need to learn how to spot the warning signs of a hack and how they can recover their accounts if someone compromises them. | O
