Experts Warn of Novel PDF-based Phishing Scam | Threatpost | The first stop for security news | AttackPhishing
   The SANS Internet Storm Center published a warning on Wednesday about an active phishing campaign that utilizes PDF attachments in a novel ploy to harvest email credentials from victims. | AttackPhishing
According to the SANS bulletin, the email has the subject line “Assessment document” and the body contains a single PDF attachment that claims to be locked. | O
A message reads: “PDF Secure File UNLOCK to Access File Content”. | O
Clicking on a link to unlock the document opens the PDF document using the computer’s default viewer. | O
A dialogue box then appears above the PDF prompting the user to input their email address and password. | O
They are not going after the most sophisticated users. | O
They are going after Joe Cubicle that may not think twice about entering credentials to unlock a PDF,” said John Bambenek, handler at SANS Internet Storm Center. | O
Bambenek suspects that attackers are harvesting credentials in hopes of gaining a small foothold into a company via an email account or to perpetuate further phishing scams. | AttackDatabreach
The email says it’s from VetMeds and the PDF is identified as a VetMeds assessment. | O
Once opened, the contents of the one-page PDF indicates that the document is a SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) banking transaction. | O
“It doesn’t matter what email address or password you input into the fake unlocking mechanism. | O
The document is opened and anything you input is transmitted to the spammer,” Bambenek said. | O
