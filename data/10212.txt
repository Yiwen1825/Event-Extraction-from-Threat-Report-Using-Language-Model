Patch Drupal now: Yet another critical website bug found – a sequel to 'Drupalgeddon2'
After scrambling to patch a critical vulnerability late last month, Drupal is at it again. | PatchVulnerability
The open source content management project has issued an unscheduled security update to augment its previous patch for Drupalgeddon2. | PatchVulnerability
There was also a cross-site scripting bug advisory in mid-April. | O
The latest Drupal core vulnerability, designated, SA-CORE-2018-004 and assigned CVE-2018-7602, is related to the March SA-CORE-2018-002 flaw (CVE-2018-7600), according to the Drupal security team. | DiscoverVulnerability 
It can be exploited to take over a website's server, and allow miscreants to steal information or alter pages. | DiscoverVulnerability
"It is a remote code execution vulnerability," explained a member of the Drupal security team in an email to The Register. | O
"No more technical details beyond that are available." | O
The vulnerability affects at least Drupal 7.x and Drupal 8.x. And a similar issue has been found in the Drupal Media module. | DiscoverVulnerability
In a blog post from earlier this month about the March patch, Dries Buytaert, founder of the Drupal project, observed that all software has security issues and critical security bugs are rare. | DiscoverVulnerability
While the March bug is being actively exploited, the Drupal security team says it's unaware of any exploitation of the latest vulnerability. | DiscoverVulnerability
But it won't be long – those maintaining the project observed automated attacks appearing about two weeks after the SA-CORE-2018-002 notice. | O
The fix is to upgrade to the most recent version of Drupal 7 or 8 core. | PatchVulnerability
The latest code can be found at Drupal's website. | O
For those running 7.x, that means upgrading to Drupal 7.59. | O 
For those running, 8.5.x, the latest version if 8.5.3. | O
And for those still on 8.4.x, there's an upgrade to 8.4.8, despite the fact that as an unsupported minor release, the 8.4.x line would not normally get security updates. | PatchVulnerability
And finally, if you're still on Drupal 6, which is no longer officially supported, unofficial patches are being developed here. | PatchVulnerability
Drupal users appear to be taking the release in stride, though with a bit of grumbling. | O
"Drupal Wednesday looks like the new Windows patch day," quipped designer Tom Binroth via Twitter. | O
"I would rather spend my time on creating new stuff than patching Drupal core sites." | PatchVulnerability
