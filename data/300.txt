Ransomware Locks Down Public Libraries at All Locations Across Saint Louis
 
 

Over 700 computers at all of SLPL's 16 branches have been hit. | O
According to library spokesperson Jen Hatton, SLPL doesn't intend to pay the ransom, which is around $35,000, about $50 per infected PC. | AttackRansom
Instead, library technicians plan to wipe and reinstall all computers from the ground up, an operation that might take a while, several local news outlets have reported [1, 2, 3, 4]. | O
Hatton said the infection took root on the night between Wednesday and Thursday. | O
By the next day, the library had to shut down all book returns and checkout operations. | O
SLPL libraries also served as public WiFi access points, allowing people to come in and use its Internet connection or computers to surf the web. | O
Internet access is also down, as the ransomware hit those servers as well, along with the staff's email system. | O
It is unknown if the ransomware infection took place because of the library's staff or because of a user that used its public computers. | O
A request for comment sent by Bleeping Computer wasn't answered at the time of publishing. | O
UPDATE [January 23]: SLPL announced today they started recovering some of the locked computers and are slowly resuming service. | O
I've been trying since this morning to get in contact with them. | O
