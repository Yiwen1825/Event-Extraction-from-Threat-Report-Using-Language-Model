Microsoft's Patch Tuesday fixes zero-day exploit and privilege escalation vulnerability | PatchVulnerability
As part of Microsoft's monthly Patch Tuesday updates, a critical flaw in Windows has been patched that is actively being exploited. | PatchVulnerability
 A vulnerability in the VBScript engine allowed for a zero-day exploit to infect machines by opening specially crafted scripts that can corrupt memory leading to the opportunity for arbitrary code execution. | DiscoverVulnerability
In a web-based attack, specially designed web pages could exploit the same vulnerability when using Internet Explorer. | O
 Embedding AcitveX controls that were marked "safe for initialization" inside of a Microsoft Office document also allowed for unsafe code to be executed since the IE rendering engine is used. | O
One of the more interesting parts of the attack is that it does not matter what a user's default browser is. | O
 When using VBScript, it is possible to force a web page to be loaded using Internet Explorer even if Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Opera or another browser is set to default. | O
 This particular vulnerability has been found in use and affects Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 and newer. | DiscoverVulnerability
Kasperksy Lab has provided a fairly detailed analysis of how the exploit functions. | O
 In short, a statement from their security researchers says it all. | O
 "We expect this vulnerability to become one of the most exploited in the near future, as it wonâ€™t be long until exploit kit authors start abusing it in both drive-by (via browser) and spear-phishing (via document) campaigns. " | AttackPhishing
In addition to the VBScript flaw discovered and patched, Microsoft has also patched a privilege escalation vulnerability. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
 A failure of the Win32k component allows for arbitrary code to be executed in kernel mode. | DiscoverVulnerability
 This allows for a standard user account to obtain full system access, although it should be noted that a user must be logged in already to perform the exploit. | O
In this case, both exploits have been patched but that does not mean end users and administrators are going to patch their systems in a timely manner. | PatchVulnerability
 It is advised to manually check for updates to verify that all of the latest patches are installed. | O
 In total, 67 updates were issued solving 21 critically rated vulnerabilities. | PatchVulnerability
