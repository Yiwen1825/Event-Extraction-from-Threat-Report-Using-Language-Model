MongoDB Databases being Targeted by Cyber-criminals for Ransom | AttackRansom
Organizations use them regardless of their size; from MetLife, LinkedIn, City of Chicago, Expedia, BuzzFeed to KMPG and The Guardian there are several other high-profile platforms that are currently taking advantage of MongoDB. | O
At the same time, having a high-profile customer doesn’t mean that platform is completely secure. | O
That’s why in 2016, in two different incidents, hackers leaked more than 36 million and 58 million accounts respectively from unsecured MongoDB. | AttackDatabreach

Now, unsecured MongoDB databases are being hijacked by a hacker, who is not only wiping out these databases but also storing copies of them and asking for a ransom of 0.2 bitcoins (roughly US$ 211) from admins in exchange of the lost data. | AttackRansom
Those admins who haven’t created backups of these databases are seriously helpless because the rate of Bitcoin is also increasing and the latest rate is 1 Bitcoin = USD1063.93. | AttackRansom
The hacking campaign was discovered by security researcher Victor Gevers, co-founder of GDI Foundation, a non-profit organization. | O
Gevers notified owners about the presence of vulnerable, non-password-protected MongoDB databases and also informed that around 200 of these installations have been wiped out by the hacker. | O
Gevers believes that the hacker(s) might be utilizing an automation tool but they manually select their target databases. | O
Hacker seems to be interested in databases that contain important information/data or he chooses companies that are most likely in a position to pay the ransom to get their data back. | AttackRansom
In a conversation with SecurityWeek, Gevers said that “They use some sort of automation tool, but they also do some of the work manually. | O
If they used a fully automated tool, we might have seen all exposed MongoDB databases being hijacked in one swift move”. | O
But that was old news; as per recent tweet by Shodan founder John Matherly, approx. | O
It must be noted that Shodan is the platform where a majority of MongoDB instances can be located. | O
As of now, 16 admins/organizations have already paid the ransom to obtain the lost data. | AttackRansom
The attacks on MongoDB databases have been going on for more than a week and servers from across the globe have been targeted. | AttackRansom
Researchers believe that the attacker, who uses the alias “harak1r1” does not encrypt the stolen data but runs a script, which replaces the database content with the ransom note. | O
