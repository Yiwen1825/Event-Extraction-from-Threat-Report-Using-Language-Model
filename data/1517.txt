While the company was able to avoid falling victim to the ransomware, the attackers may have been able to access patient data. | Databreach
On February 6, 2017, an employee noticed that a virus had begun encrypting the practice's servers. | Databreach
The encryption process was slowed by the company's anti-virus software, and ABCD's IT company was able to take its servers offline and identify the virus as Dharma Ransomware, a variant of Crysis for which decryption tools are available. | Databreach
"ABCD's IT company reported that these virus strains typically do not exfiltrate ('remove') data from the server; however, exfiltration could not be ruled out," the company said in a statement. | Databreach
"Also, during the analysis of ABCD's servers and computers, suspicious user accounts were discovered suggested that hackers may have accessed portions of ABCD's network." | Databreach
The IT company was able to remove the virus and all corrupt data from its servers, and successfully restored all affected data from a secure backup. | Databreach
"As a result, no confidential information was lost or destroyed, including protected health information," the company said. | O
