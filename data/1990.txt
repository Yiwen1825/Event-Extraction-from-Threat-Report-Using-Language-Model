No, Netflix is not a victim of Ransomware | CSO Online
Over the weekend, a hacker known as TheDarkOverlord resurfaced and released the first episode of season five for "Orange is the New Black" a popular show on Netflix that isn't slated to air until June. | AttackDatabreach
A short time later, TheDarkOverlord released episodes 2 though 10, along with a warning to other Hollywood studios â€“ you're next. | AttackDatabreach
The media jumped on the story.  | O
Netflix wouldn't confirm or deny the leaked episodes were legitimate, stating that proper law enforcement had been notified, and that a company used by several TV studios "had its security compromised." | AttackDatabreach
The company in question, Larson Studios, does audio post-production work for a number of shows and films, including NCIS Los Angeles, Designated Survivor, and Arrested Development.  | O
According to Larson Studios, they've done work for FOX, Netflix, ABC, NBC, IFC, Showtime, and more. | O
As word of Netflix's security problem started to spread, news outlets starting comparing the incident to the Sony Pictures hack and the medical hacks over the last few years.  | O
While there are some comparisons to be made, they're not the same type of threat. | O
Netflix didn't have a Ransomware incident, and neither did Larson Studios.  | O
Their files were stolen, not encrypted. | AttackDatabreach
Ransomware encrypts the files on a computer and renders them useless.  | AttackRansom
Victims can recover the files if they pay a fee (ransom), or they can try and recover the files from backups. | AttackRansom
According to TheDarkOverlord, Larson Studios was targeted because they were a post-production company. | AttackDatabreach
Late last year, TheDarkOverlord hacked Larson Studios and downloaded an unknown number of files.  | AttackDatabreach
Plenty of reporters knew TheDarkOverlord had targeted Hollywood, but until this weekend there was never any proof. | O
Fast forward a few months.  | O
When Larson Studios didn't comply with the extortion demands, TheDarkOverlord turned their attention to Netflix.  | AttackRansom, Databreach
When Netflix refused to pay, season five (minus three episodes) of "Orange is the New Black" was released for download. | AttackDatabreach
"It didn't have to be this way, Netflix.  | O
You're going to lose a lot more money in all of this than what our modest offer was.  | O
We're quite ashamed to breathe the same air as you.  | O
We figured a pragmatic business such as yourselves would see and understand the benefits of cooperating with a reasonable and merciful entity like ourselves," TheDarkOverlord wrote in a statement. | O
Netflix surpassed $2.5 billion in quarterly streaming revenue in Q1 2017, and added five million members to their subscriber base.  | O
While having one of their popular series leaked to the web isn't exactly helpful, it isn't clear if there will be any financial impact from this incident. | O
Once again, extortion and Ransomware are two separate things. | O
Netflix and Larson Studios are (were) being extorted, they were not infected with Ransomware and have complete access to their files. | AttackRansom, Databreach
However, there is a lesson to be learned.  | O
Third-parties are always going to pose a risk to any organization, and this is certainly the case in Hollywood where secrecy and suspense are key to their business model. | O
