This TV licence refund email is a scam
There’s a new scam on the block and over 200 people have already been hit. | O
Here’s what you need to know about the TV Licence con. | O
Action Fraud is warning that criminals are sending out emails pretending to be from TV Licensing. | AttackPhishing
The watchdog says it has already received over 200 reports about the phishing scam. | AttackPhishing
The email lures you in by saying you are owed a refund on your TV Licence payments. | AttackPhishing
But, it’s a con and all the senders are really after is your bank details. | O
What does the email say? | O
So far all the emails have been the same. | O
They say: | O
“This is an official notification from TV Licensing! | O
“We would like to notify you that, after the last annual calculation we have determined that you are eligible to receive a TV Licensing refund of 85.07 GBP. | O
“Due to invalid account details records, we were unable to credit your account. | O
Please fill in the TV Licensing refund request and allow us 5-6 working days to the amount to be credited to your account.” | O
All this is untrue. | O
If you receive this email the best thing to do is report it to Action Fraud and then delete it. | O
Do not click on any links within the email. | O
“A small number of our customers have received scam email messages saying they are due a refund,” a spokesperson for TV Licensing has said. | AttackPhishing
“A link directs customers to a fake version of the official TV Licensing website which asks them to enter personal information and bank details. | AttackPhishing
“If you receive a similar email message please delete it. | O
If you have already clicked the link, do not enter or submit any information. | O
TV Licensing never sends refund information by email and is investigating the source of the fraud.” | O
While these emails are a scam they carry an element of truth – you might be due a refund from TV Licensing. | O
There are a number of ways you can avoid paying the full licence fee. | O
If you are a student you are entitled to a £37 discount on the £147.50 colour TV licence. | O
You can also apply for a refund if you’ve paid for a TV Licence beyond your 75th birthday. | O
Anyone over the age of 75 is entitled to watch TV for free. | O
TV Licences apply to households not individuals so if anyone if your household is a student, or over 75 then you all get the benefit of their discount. | O
Similarly, if someone in your house is severely visually impaired they are entitled to a half-price TV licence. | O
You can apply for a refund via the official TV Licensing Website. | O
