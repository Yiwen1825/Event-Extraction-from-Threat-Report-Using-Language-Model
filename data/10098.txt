 U.S. Says North Korea 'Directly Responsible' For WannaCry Ransomware Attack  
The White House has publicly blamed North Korea for a ransomware attack in May that locked more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries. | AttackRansom
"North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade," Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert said at a White House briefing Tuesday morning. | O
He called the WannaCry attack a reckless attack that caused "havoc and destruction" by locking vital information away from users, including hospital networks. | AttackRansom
"We believe now we have the evidence to support this assertion," Bossert said. | O 
"It's very difficult to do when you're looking for individual hackers. | O 
In this case, we found a concerted effort." | O
In an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Bossert wrote that after careful investigation, Washington can say that Pyongyang is "directly responsible" for the WannaCry virus. | O
Bossert called the attack in which victims received ransom demands to unlock their computers "cowardly, costly and careless." | AttackRansom
"The consequences and repercussions of WannaCry were beyond economic," he wrote. | O 
"The malicious software hit computers in the U.K.'s health-care sector particularly hard, compromising systems that perform critical work. | AttackRansom 
These disruptions put lives at risk." | O
Bossert is expected to brief reporters on Tuesday about the hacking. | O
NPR's Elise Hu tells Morning Edition that "cyberattacks are a way for North Korea to punch above its weight" and that Pyongyang's hackers "have access to global networks and the Internet, and they have some real successes to count." | O
Within days of the attack in May, North Korea fell under suspicion. | AttackRansom 
As NPR's Bill Chappell reported at the time, WannaCry was found to have "lines of code that are identical to work by hackers known as the Lazarus Group, [which has] ... been linked to North Korea, raising suspicions that the nation could be responsible." | O
And in October, Britain's Minister of State for Security Ben Wallace said his government was "as sure as possible" that Pyongyang launched the attack. | AttackRansom
Bossert said in the Journal that President Trump had "ordered the modernization of government information-technology to enhance the security of the systems we run on behalf of the American people." | O
"We also indicted Russian hackers and a Canadian acting in concert with them. | O 
A few weeks ago, we charged three Chinese nationals for hacking, theft of trade secrets and identity theft. | AttackDatabreach 
There will almost certainly be more indictments to come," he wrote. | O
He said that the administration would continue to use its "maximum pressure strategy to curb Pyongyang's ability to mount attacks, cyber or otherwise." | O
