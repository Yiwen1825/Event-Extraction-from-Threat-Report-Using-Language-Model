Ransomware shuts down Licking County government in Ohio | AttackRansom
The government of Licking County in the US has taken many of its computer and telephone systems offline as it tries to tackle a ransomware infection. | O
Ransomware is a type of computer malware that scrambles data and demands a fee for it to be restored. | AttackRansom
Citizens have been told they must visit government offices to do tasks usually completed online or by phone. | O
The county commissioner told local media that he was taking advice from cybersecurity experts and the FBI. | O
Licking County, which is in Ohio, has about 170,000 residents. | O
The local government says it has about 1,000 computers and 12 servers, which have been taken offline making many government websites inaccessible. | O
Many of the county's public services, including the emergency services, have resorted to working in "manual mode" without their computers, to prevent the malware being spread to more devices. | O
Residents are still able to call 911 in an emergency but the process may take longer than usual. | O
"It's slower than we'd like," Sean Grady, director of the Licking County Emergency Management Agency, told the Newark Advocate. | O
"It takes us back 25 years in how we dispatch. | O 
We ask more detailed questions." | O
County commissioner Tim Bubb said the malware was a "crime against the people of Licking County" but added that the government had not been specifically targeted. | O
"Clearly, it's designed to make money for somebody. | O 
It was just our unlucky day," he said. | O
Some variants of ransomware have previously been defeated, with removal instructions now available online. | O
However, security experts warn that in some cases the only way to get data back is by restoring from a back-up. | O
Mr Bubb said he was exploring that option, but did not know how long it would take for computer systems to be back online. | O
"We're evaluating our back-ups. | O
We think our back-ups are pretty darn good," he said. | O
