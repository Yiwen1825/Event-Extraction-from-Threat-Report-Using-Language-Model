Valentine’s Day is fast-approaching and the story goes that if Cupid hits you with his golden arrow you’ll fall madly in love. | O
But there are other actors taking aim at you on Valentine’s Day whose arrows you need to avoid as the outcomes aren’t nearly as desirable. | O
Think back to early February 2016, when many online florists experienced a surge in traffic that wasn’t due simply to a rush to buy flowers. | O
Dozens of florists were hit by targeted DDoS attacks during their busiest time of the year, causing problems for some and knocking others offline who were asked to pay a ransom before they could resume operations. | AttackRansom
It’s fairly typical for bad actors to escalate extortion-based campaigns during seasonal events when the stakes for targets are high. | AttackRansom
Looking to profit with minimal investment, attackers exploit known vulnerabilities as they attempt to breach systems. | O
For example, the 2016 Valentine’s Day DDoS attacks used Shellshock, a critical vulnerability that’s present in Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X that had been discovered more than a year earlier. | DiscoverVulnerability
Of course, online florists are not alone when it comes to being targeted by cyber criminals. | O
Different times of the year and major news events can trigger a surge in attacks aimed at particular industries and geographies. | O
Organisations need to understand their threat model and apply security processes as appropriate. | O
Threat actors will continue to take advantage of events to launch attacks, but you can avoid their arrows this Valentine’s Day. | O
