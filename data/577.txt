New Malware Underscores the Danger of Assumed Mac Security | The Mac Security Blog | O
This week researchers found a piece of malware in the wild, built to steal passwords from the macOS keychain. | AttackDatabreach
Named "MacDownloader" and posing as, what else, a fake Flash Player update, the new malware was found on the Mac of a human rights advocate and believed to originate from Iran. | AttackPhishing
The malware's code is very sloppy and appears to have been made by an amateur who took pieces of other's code and repurposed them. | O
The threat report mentions the following: | O
MacDownloader seems to be poorly developed and created towards the end of 2016, potentially a first attempt from an amateur developer. | O
In multiple cases, the code used has been copied from elsewhere. | O
The simple activity of downloading the remote file appears to have been sourced from a cheat sheet. | O
The main purpose of MacDownloader seems to be to perform an initial profiling of the infected system and collection of credentials from macOS’s Keychain password manager – which mirrors the focus of Windows malware developed by the same actors. | AttackDatabreach
At this time, it appears the malware is not a threat and the Command & Control server has been taken down. | O
Intego VirusBarrier offers protection from this malware, detected as OSX/MacDownloader. | O
Security researchers found that this malware was originally designed as a fake Bitdefender antivirus, but was later repackaged as a fake Flash Player update. | AttackPhishing
Once installed, the malware attempts to achieve persistence by use of a poorly implemented shell script, which at the time of writing did not function due to the C&C server being offline. | O
MacDownloader displays a fake Flash Player update that offers an "Update Flash-Player" button and a "Close" button. | AttackPhishing
Unlike other malware of its kind, clicking the Close button actually exists the installer and nothing malicious is placed on the system. | O
If the Update button is clicked though, a malware dialog will pop-up, which is, of course, fake as well. | O
These dialogues are also rife with basic typos and grammatical errors, indicating that the developer paid little attention to quality control. | O
After a user clicks on OK, the software mimics the System Preferences to request the admin password in order to grab more info on the system. | O
If the user enters their password and clicks OK, the software grabs the info, and then it tries to open a remote connection to: | O
MacDownloader collects user keychain information and uploads it to said C&C server, including documents the running processes, installed applications and the username and password, which are acquired through a fake System Preferences dialog. | AttackDatabreach
The name and password, which in almost all cases are Administrator credentials, give the malware everything it needs to access the keychain information. | O
With access to the keychain the sky is the limit, because email account passwords, social network account details, and much more, are all stored in the keychain. | AttackDatabreach
