    A globally co-ordinated cyber attack has hit 500 industrial companies in 50 countries in the past few months, according to security company Kaspersky. | O
The worst affected were companies in the smelting, electric power generation and transmission, construction, and engineering industries. | O
The attacks take the form of emails purportedly from famous companies – such as DHL and Saudi Aramco – and most were sent from “legitimate email addresses belonging to valid organizations”, says Kaspersky. | Phishing
However, Kaspersky says its analysis of the emails compared to known malware shows that “no new code was written specifically for this attack”. | O
Kaspersky says the hackers could have accessed and read previous communications between the target and their partners. | Databreach
They may then have used this information to craft email communications which appear to be legitimate, so that the victim didn’t recognize the malicious aspect of the email. | Phishing
If the email is opened, it can steal the user’s authentication credentials, which are send to a remote server. | Databreach
