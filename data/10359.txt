Logitech flaw fixed after Project Zero disclosure
When it comes to fixing security vulnerabilities, it should be clear by now that words only count when they’re swiftly followed by actions. | PatchVulnerability
Ask peripherals maker Logitech, which last week became the latest company to find itself on the receiving end of an embarrassing public flaw disclosure by Google’s Project Zero team. | DiscoverVulnerability
In September, Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy installed Logitech’s Options application for Windows (available separately for Mac), used to customise buttons on the company’s keyboards, mice, and touchpads. | O
Pretty quickly, he noticed some problems with the application’s design, starting with the fact that it… opens a websocket server on port 10134 that any website can connect to, and has no origin checking at all. | DiscoverVulnerability
Websockets simplify the communication between a client and a server and, unlike HTTP, make it possible for servers to send data to clients without first being asked to, which creates additional security risks. | O
    The only “authentication” is that you have to provide a pid [process ID] of a process owned by your user, but you get unlimited guesses so you can bruteforce it in microseconds. | O
Ormandy claimed this might offer attackers a way of executing keystroke injection to take control of a Windows PC running the software. | DiscoverVulnerability
Within days of contacting Logitech, Ormandy says he had a meeting to discuss the vulnerability with its engineers on 18 September, who assured him they understood the problem. | DiscoverVulnerability
A new version of Options appeared on 1 October without a fix, although in fairness to Logitech that was probably too soon for any patch for Ormandy’s vulnerability to be included. | PatchVulnerability
As anyone who’s followed Google’s Project Zero will know, it operates a strict 90-day deadline for a company to fix vulnerabilities disclosed to it, after which they are made public. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
    I would recommend disabling Logitech Options until an update is available. | PatchVulnerability
Clearly, the disclosure got things moving – on 13 December, Logitech suddenly updated Options to version 7.00.564 (7.00.554 for Mac). | PatchVulnerability
The company also tweeted that the flaws had been fixed, confirmed by Ormandy on the same day. | PatchVulnerability
Logitech aren’t the first to feel Project Zero’s guillotine on their neck. | O
Earlier in 2018, Microsoft ran into a similar issue over a vulnerability found by Project Zero in the Edge browser. | DiscoverVulnerability
Times have changed – vendors have to move from learning about a bug to releasing a fix much more rapidly than they used to. | PatchVulnerability
