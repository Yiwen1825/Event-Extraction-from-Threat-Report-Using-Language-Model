Netflix Scam Spreads Ransomware | AttackRansom
A newly discovered threat aims to steal Netflix user credentials and hold them hostage, according to researchers at Trend Micro. | AttackDatabreach
Netflix has 93 million subscribers in more than 190 countries. | O
It's a popular app, but many people aren't willing to pay the monthly subscription fee. | O
They'll try to bypass the cost and watch content for free - and cybercriminals are now taking advantage of them. | O
This newly detected ransomware, RANSOM_NETIX.A, aims to trick Windows PC users with a login generator typically used for software and account membership piracy. | AttackPhishing
Victims click a "Generate Login" button to kick-start the encryption process. | O
The ransomware uses fake login prompts as a distraction while it encrypts 39 file types under the C:\Users directory. | AttackRansom
The program then demands $100 in Bitcoin from victims. | AttackRansom
While it targets Windows users, it's worth noting the ransomware destroys itself on systems not running Windows 7 or Windows 10. | O
Netflix, with its massive user base, presents a tempting opportunity for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities, infect systems to steal user data, and monetize data on the dark Web. | AttackDatabreach
Stolen credentials can be used to bargain among criminals or trick victims into installing malware, which can generate profit. | AttackPhishing
"We regularly see threat actors utilize popular apps or services as a lure to get victims to infect themselves," explains Jon Clay, global director of threat communications at Trend Micro. | AttackPhishing
"Also, by using imagery that is similar to the real vendor's imagery, [criminals] trick the victim into thinking it's real." | AttackPhishing
Clay says this discovery marks a continuation of 2016 ransomware trends, which included the creation of new tactics to generate more victims. | O
After seeing nearly 750% growth in new ransomware families in 2016, Trend Micro predicted 25% growth in new families for 2017. | O
The Netflix scam carries implications for how ransomware will evolve later in the year. | O
"We will likely see other popular vendors targeted with their brands, especially if the actors behind [the Netflix scam] find success," he continues. | O
"They will use this tactic again with other vendors." | O
This is a wake-up call for potential victims to protect their accounts. | O
Best practices include regularly updating account credentials, employing two-factor authentication, limiting downloads to official sources, and being wary of illegitimate emails. | O
Businesses should educate their employees on how ransomware threats work, and how using legitimate brands in social engineering attacks can trick victims into making dangerous decisions. | AttackPhishing
Employees should be aware that trying to obtain a free Netflix account is "bogus," says Clay, and should not be acted upon. | O
If a deal seems too good to be true, it typically is. | O
