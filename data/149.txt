Hancitor/Pony/Vawtrak malspam - SANS Internet Storm Center | AttackPhishing
   Introduction | O 
Until recently, I hadn't personally seen much malicious spam (malspam) using Microsoft office documents with Hancitor-based Visual Basic (VB) macros to send Pony and Vawtrak. | O 
Occasionally, I'll find a report like this one from 2016-12-19, where Hancitor/Pony/Vawtrak malspam was disguised as a LogMeIn account notification, but I rarely come across an example on my own. | AttackPhishing
And apparently, there's been a recent lull in Hancitor/Pony/Vawtrak malspam until yesterday. | AttackPhishing
