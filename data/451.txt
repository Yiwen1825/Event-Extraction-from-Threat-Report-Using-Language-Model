Ugly Password Gaffe Plagues Cryptkeeper Encryption App  | Threatpost | The first stop for security news | O
A longtime Debian developer has recommended that the Cryptkeeper Linux encryption app be removed from the distribution. | DiscoverVulnerability
The advice came after the disclosure of a bug where the app sets the universal password “p” to decrypt any directory created with the program. | DiscoverVulnerability
Simon McVittie, a programmer at Collabora, confirmed the findings of researcher Kirill Tkhai, who disclosed the bug Jan. 26. | DiscoverVulnerability
McVittie said he was able to reproduce the bug in the Stretch version (Debian 9, in testing), but not in the Jessie version (Debian 8). | DiscoverVulnerability
“I have recommended that the release team remove this package from stretch: it currently gives a false sense of security that is worse than not encrypting at all,” McVittie said in response to the original bug report. | DiscoverVulnerability
Francesco Namuri, another Debian developer, agreed the Cryptkeeper packages should be yanked from Debian. | O
Tkhai’s advisory said Cryptkeeper version 0.9.5-5.1 is affected. | O
The problem appears when Cryptkeeper calls encfs, a command line interface for the encrypted file system. | O
Encfs simulates a ‘p’ keystroke but the uses it instead as a universal password. | O
