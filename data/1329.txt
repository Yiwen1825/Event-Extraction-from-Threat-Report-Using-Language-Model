The user provided the screenshot shown above, which attempts to instill fear with the claim the device was being locked "for illegal pornography." | O
Below those words was a pop-up Window that said "Cannot Open Page." | O
Each time the person clicked on the accompanying OK button, a new window would open again. | O

Sites tailored the messages they delivered based on country identifiers. | O
The campaign in many respects resembles one that hit Android users in 2014. | Ransom, DiscoverVulnerability
