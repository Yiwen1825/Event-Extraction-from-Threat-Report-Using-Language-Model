MongoDB ransom attacks continue to plague administrators | CSO Online | AttackRansom
   Earlier this month, Salted Hash reported on a surge in attacks against publicly accessible MongoDB installations. | O
Since January 3, the day of that first report, the number of victims has climbed from about 200 databases to more than 40,000. | O
In addition to MongoDB, those responsible for the attacks have started targeting Elasticsearch and CouchDB. | O
No matter the platform being targeted, the message to the victim is the same; send a small Bitcoin payment to the listed address, or forever lose access to your files. | AttackRansom

The problem is, some of the more recent attacks show evidence the database was erased. | AttackRansom
So even if the ransom is paid, the data is lost for good. | AttackRansom
The researchers tracking these attacks are aware of at least four individuals who delete the databases entirely after running a list command. | O
Once deleted, theyâ€™ll leave the ransom note and logoff the system. | AttackRansom
So far, these individuals have used more than a dozen Bitcoin wallet addresses, and nine different email accounts. | O
The tracking document is available on Google Docs. | O
Only one of those victims had backups to use when the ransom payment failed. | AttackRansom
Soon, criminals started going after other development platforms, such as Elasticsearch - a Java-based search engine that's popular in enterprise environments. | O
Then they moved on to public facing Hadoop and CouchDB deployments. | O
