Around 2.15 pm, a message flashed on the complainant’s computer screen saying, “You have to pay for decryption in bitcoins. | AttackRansom 
The price depends on how fast you write to us. | O 
After payment, we will send you the decryption key, which will decrypt all your files.” | O

Around 7 pm, when the complainant tried to use a computer for some work, he could not access the data. | O 
When he tried other computers, he faced the same problem. | O 
He also found that some data and software had been deleted. | O  
Suspecting that a computer virus may be behind this, he copied the other files still available from the computer. | O
The complainant then left for the day and asked an employee from the information technology department to look into the matter. | O 
The employee later told him that the data had not been deleted but encrypted by fraudsters. | O
On Sunday, the MGM hospital in Navi Mumbai was attacked by a ransomware. | AttackRansom
