Google discloses another Windows 10 security flaw before a patch is ready 
Google disclosed a flaw in Microsoft Edge earlier this week, after Microsoft failed to patch the bug in time. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
 Now Google’s Project Zero team of security researchers are disclosing yet another Windows 10 security flaw that Microsoft has again failed to patch before Google’s imposed 90-day period. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
 Neowin spotted that Google reported two bugs to Microsoft in November, but the company only addressed one of them with its recent Patch Tuesday fixes. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
The latest unpatched issue is an Elevation of Privilege which allows a normal user to gain administrator privileges on a system. | DiscoverVulnerability
 Microsoft has rated the flaw as “important,” but not “critical” as it can’t be exploited remotely. | DiscoverVulnerability
 It’s still an important issue to fix, as an attacker could potentially combine this with a separate unknown remote code execution to gain administrator access, although that’s an unlikely scenario unless Microsoft doesn’t address it promptly. | PatchVulnerability
It’s not clear when Microsoft intends to address the latest security flaw in Windows 10, and the company still needs to solve the Edge vulnerability that was disclosed by Google earlier this week. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
 Microsoft hit back at Google’s approach to security patches last year, after discovering a Chrome flaw and “responsibly” disclosed it to Google so the company had enough time to patch. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
Google’s policy to disclose after 90 days without a patch is often criticized and applauded in equal measure. | O
 There’s plenty of evidence to suggest security vulnerabilities are increasing in Windows and across the industry, and Microsoft has clearly struggled to fix these two issues with plenty of notice. | PatchVulnerability
 It can also be argued that Google is making rival software more secure with its efforts, making everyone’s software secure. | O
 However, Google also has competitive commercial interests, and Project Zero has been unusually aggressive in finding and publishing new vulnerabilities. | O
Reports suggest Google’s Project Zero security team originated from the fallout around the 2009 Google hack, an intrusion blamed on an unpatched flaw in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 6 browser. | O
Google makes exceptions to its strict rules, with grace periods, and can even disclose much sooner if the vulnerability is being actively exploited. | DiscoverVulnerability
 Google disclosed a major Windows bug back in 2016 just 10 days after reporting it to Microsoft, and the company has revealed zero-day bugs in Windows in the past before patches are available. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
