WordPress admins, take note: RCE and password reset vulnerabilities revealed - Help Net Security | DiscoverVulnerability
Independent security researcher Dawid Golunski has released a proof-of-concept exploit code for an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in WordPress 4.6 (CVE-2016-10033), and information about an unauthorized password reset zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2017-8295) in the latest version of the popular CMS. | DiscoverVulnerability
The vulnerability exists in the PHPMailer library, and can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers to gain access to and compromise an target application server on which a vulnerable WordPress Core version is installed (in its default configuration). | DiscoverVulnerability
“No plugins or non-standard settings are required to exploit the vulnerability,” Golunski noted. | DiscoverVulnerability

The hole has been responsibly disclosed to the WordPress Foundation, and has been plugged in January, with the release of WordPress 4.7.1. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
Still, according to the Foundation’s own numbers, nearly 11 percent of all WordPress installation out there are still stuck on the vulnerable version 4.6. | O
And, as Golunski noted, it’s possible that older WordPress versions are also affected by the same flaw, so the percentage of vulnerable installations could be considerably higher: | DiscoverVulnerability

Admins who still run these older versions of the popular CMS should upgrade to newer versions, ideally to the latest one (v4.7.4). | PatchVulnerability
Still, even that might not be a guarantee against compromise, as Golunski has also publicly released information and POC code for an unauthorized password reset vulnerability (CVE-2017-8295) that the WordPress Foundation is yet to patch. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
According to him and BeyondSecurity, whose SecuriTeam coordinated the disclosure of the flaw to the WordPress developers, the discovery of the vulnerability dates back to mid-2016. | DiscoverVulnerability
Golunski found it in version 4.3.1 of the CMS. | DiscoverVulnerability
“WordPress has a password reset feature that contains a vulnerability which might in some cases allow attackers to get hold of the password reset link without previous authentication. | DiscoverVulnerability
Such attack could lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized access to a victim’s WordPress account,” BeyondSecurity explained. | O
“The vulnerability stems from WordPress using untrusted data by default when creating a password reset e-mail that is supposed to be delivered only to the e-mail associated with the owner’s account.”| O
Golunski says that the issue was reported to the WordPress security team multiple times, but they did not confirm whether it has been patched. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
He ultimately decided to publish his findings, and offer a temporary solution (“users can enable UseCanonicalName to enforce static SERVER_NAME value”). | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
