Cisco WebEx code execution hole – what you need to know – Naked Security | DiscoverVulnerability
The big security issue of the week is a remote code execution hole related to the Cisco WebEx service. | DiscoverVulnerability
WebEx is a popular collaboration tool for online events such as meetings, webinars and videoconferences. | O
Like many services of this sort, you access online events via your browser, augmented by a special-purpose browser extension. | O
Browser extensions and plugins allow web developers to extend the software features inside your browser with a mixture of scripts and program code, for example to add configuration options or to support new audio and video formats. | O
Of course, when you add  another layer of programmatic complexity on top of an already-complex browser, it’s easy to add new security holes, too. | O
Perhaps the best known example of a problematic plugin is Adobe Flash, which has provided cybercrooks with such a fruitful source of exploitable security holes over the years that we have long been urging you to try to live without Flash altogether. | O
The latest security scare of this sort has been dubbed CVE-2017-3823, and it applies to Cisco’s special-purpose WebEx browser extension. | DiscoverVulnerability
In oher words, if your organisation uses WebEx, you probably have the browser extension installed, and if you have it installed, you may be at risk. | O
According to Tavis Ormandy at Google’s Project Zero, who discovered and documented the bug, there are more than 20 million WebEx users worldwide. | DiscoverVulnerability
According to Cisco, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox on Windows are affected. | O
Microsoft Edge on Windows and all browsers on Mac and Linux are safe. | O
The most recent update for Chrome is Cisco WebEx extension 1.0.7. | O
Cisco published a notification about this update at 2017-01-26T19:45Z, having issued and then withdrawn 1.0.3 and then 1.0.5 earlier this week after deeming them “incomplete”. | O
However, at 2017-01-26T19:45Z, Cisco’s official Security Advisory page says: | O
Cisco is currently developing updates that address this vulnerability for Firefox and Internet Explorer. | PatchVulnerability
There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. | O
Using Microsoft Edge on Windows or any browser on Mac or Linux will shield you from this bug because it doesn’t apply on those platforms. | O
You can also turn off WebEx support in your browser temporarily, thus preventing the Cisco extension or add-on from activating unexpectedly. | O
