Network management vulnerability exposes cable modems to hacking | CSO Online
Hundreds of thousands of internet gateway devices around the world, primarily residential cable modems, are vulnerable to hacking because of a serious weakness in their Simple Network Management Protocol implementation. | DiscoverVulnerability
SNMP is used for automated network device identification, monitoring and remote configuration.  | O
It is supported and enabled by default in many devices, including servers, printers, networking hubs, switches and routers. | DiscoverVulnerability
Independent researchers Ezequiel Fernandez and Bertin Bervis recently found a way to bypass SNMP authentication on 78 models of cable modems that ISPs from around the world have provided to their customers. | DiscoverVulnerability
Their internet scans revealed hundreds of thousands of devices whose configurations could be changed remotely through the SNMP weakness that they found and dubbed StringBleed. | DiscoverVulnerability
The leaking of sensitive configuration data through the default "public" SNMP community string is a known problem that has affected many devices over the years. | DiscoverVulnerability, Databreach
The two researchers first located a small number of vulnerable devices, including the Cisco DPC3928SL cable modem that's now part of Technicolor's product portfolio following the company's acquisition of Cisco's Connected Devices division in 2015. | DiscoverVulnerability
The researchers claim that when they reported the issue to Technicolor, the company told them that it was the result of an access misconfiguration by a single ISP in Mexico rather than a problem with the device itself. | DiscoverVulnerability
This prompted the researchers to perform a wider internet scan that resulted in the discovery of 78 vulnerable cable modem models from 19 manufacturers, including Cisco, Technicolor, Motorola, D-Link and Thomson. | DiscoverVulnerability
Regardless of the cause, the problem is serious, as attackers could exploit this flaw to extract administrative and Wi-Fi passwords or to hijack devices by modifying their configurations. | DiscoverVulnerability
There's not much that users can do if their ISP supplied them with a vulnerable device, other than ask for a different model or install their own modem.  | O
Unfortunately, not many ISPs allow their residential customers to use their own gateway devices, because they want uniformity and remote management capabilities on their networks. | DiscoverVulnerability
Determining if a particular device is vulnerable to this issue is possible, but requires a bit of work.  | DiscoverVulnerability
An online port scanner like ShieldsUp can be used to determine if the device responds to SNMP requests over its public IP address. | O
If SNMP is open, a different online tool can be used to check if the device's SNMP server returns valid responses when the "public" or random community strings are used.  | O
At the very least this would indicate an information leak problem. | O
