Google Shuts Down Docs Phishing Spree | Threatpost | The first stop for security news | O
Google said it has disabled offending accounts involved in a widespread spree of phishing emails today impersonating Google Docs. | AttackPhishing

Once the “Open in Docs” button is clicked, the victim is redirected to Google’s OAUTH2 service and the user is prompted to allow the attacker’s malicious application, called “Google Docs,” below, to access their Google account and related services, including contacts, Gmail, Docs and more. | O

“We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” a Google spokesperson told Threatpost. | AttackPhishing

While this attack is likely the work of a spammer, nation-state attackers including APT28, aka Fancy Bear or Sofacy, have made use of this tactic. | O
APT28 has been linked to last summer’s attacks attempting to influence the U.S. presidential elections. | AttackPhishing
The group has long been targeting political entities, including NATO, and uses phishing emails, backdoors and data-stealing malware to conduct espionage campaigns against its targets. | O
“I don’t believe they are behind this though because this is way too widespread,” said Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at AlienVault. | O
“Many people and organizations have received similar attempts, so this is probably something massive and less targeted.” | O
