The D in SystemD stands for Dammmit... Security holes found in much-adored Linux toolkit 
Security biz Qualys has revealed three vulnerabilities in a component of systemd, a system and service manager used in most major Linux distributions. | DiscoverVulnerability
Patches for the three flaws – CVE-2018-16864, CVE-2018-16865, and CVE-2018-16866 – should appear in distro repos soon as a result of coordinated disclosure. | PatchVulnerability
However, Linux distributions such as Debian remain vulnerable at the moment, depending on the version you have installed. | DiscoverVulnerability
"They're aware of the issues and they're releasing patches," said Jimmy Graham, director of product management at Qualys, in a phone interview with The Register. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
"I don't believe Red Hat has released one but it should be coming shortly." | PatchVulnerability
The bugs were found in systemd-journald, a part of systemd that handles the collection and storage of log data. | O
The first two CVEs refer to memory corruption flaws while the third involves an out of bounds error that can leak data. | DiscoverVulnerability
CVE-2018-16864 can be exploited by malware running on a Linux box, or a malicious logged-in user, to crash and potentially hijack the systemd-journald system service, elevating access from user to root. | DiscoverVulnerability
CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 can be exploited together by a local attacker to crash or hijack the root-privileged journal service. | DiscoverVulnerability
While systemd isn't universally beloved in the Linux community, Graham sees nothing unusual about the presence of the three flaws in the software. | O
"The noteworthiness to me is that it is very commonly found in most major distributions," he said. | O
Qualys contends all systemd-based Linux distros are vulnerable, though the vulnerabilities cannot be exploited in SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, openSUSE Leap 15.0, and Fedora 28 and 29 because their user-land code is compiled with GCC's -fstack-clash-protection option. | DiscoverVulnerability
The security biz calls it a simplified stack clash – where the size of the stack gets changed to overlap with other memory areas – because it only requires the last two steps in a four step process: Clashing the stack with another memory region, moving the stack-pointer to the stack start, jumping over the stack guard-page into another memory region, and smashing the stack or memory space. | O
The third bug, CVE-2018-16866, appeared in June 2015 (systemd v221) and, Qualys says, was fixed inadvertently in August 2018. | DiscoverVulnerability, PatchVulnerability
In code where the flaw still exists, it could allow an attacker to read out of bounds information, resulting in information leakage. | DiscoverVulnerability
"The risk [of these issues] is a local privilege escalation to root," said Graham. | O
"It's something that should still be a concern because usually attackers don't just use one vulnerability to comprise a system. | O
They often chain vulnerabilities together."  | O
